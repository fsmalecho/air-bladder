/**
 * Content-localization overlay for Mondolme — DISPLAY-ONLY.
 *
 * UI strings go through Foundry i18n (lang/*.json, merged over English). Compendium
 * CONTENT — item / background / table / monster names and descriptions — does not:
 * it lives in editable packs whose canonical language is ENGLISH. This is a small,
 * in-system equivalent of the Babele module (a system cannot *require* a module, so
 * content Spanish must be intrinsic to the system).
 *
 * DESIGN: translate ONLY at display / emit time; NEVER mutate a stored document and
 * NEVER bake a translated string onto an actor. Consequences that make this the
 * safe choice, and why there is no "slug refactor":
 *   - Every pack doc and every actor item keeps its English name, so all
 *     name-matching stays English<->English: pack resolution (module/gear.js),
 *     table lookups, and the background-swap identity match in
 *     character-generator.js (untagged mundane gear matched by name) are untouched.
 *   - A world that switches language re-localizes for free — nothing was baked.
 *
 * KEYING is by (namespace, normalized English source) — gettext-style, immune to
 * the importer-regenerated _ids — and a miss returns the English source unchanged,
 * so a partial overlay degrades per-string to English and never blanks or throws.
 * The translatable-field taxonomy is defined by tools/i18n/extract-content.mjs;
 * keep the two in step.

 * surface this system localizes: all four world directory tabs, the compendium
 * sidebar and the combat tracker are applications without a `.document` too.

 * The sidebar tabs are NAMED rather than swept by `.collection`, because that
 * property does not separate them from the tabs that must be left alone —
