 * The Warden's damage: traps, environments, conditions.

 * sheet, so a pit, a poison, a fright and a failed save against exhaustion had
 * to be applied by hand on each sheet — with no card, no STR save, no Scar, no
 * death bar, and nothing in the log.
 *
 * A HAZARD IS A WEAPON NOBODY IS HOLDING, and that is the whole design. Almost
 * none of this is new: everything downstream of the roll is already
 * source-agnostic — `applyToTarget` wants a token id, a number and a scene and
 * has no notion of who swung — so this posts the ORDINARY damage card and the
 * flow that already ships does the rest (the splat, `askDamageTargets`, the
 * detail cards, the STR save, the Scar draw, the status bars, the attribution
 * line). What is genuinely new is a way to open the dialog, and the POOL.
 *
 * It lives in its own file rather than in `utils.js` because it owns a Foundry
 * surface — the scene-controls palette — that nothing else here touches.

 * (`options.content = options.content.innerHTML`, dialog.mjs:187-191), so the
 * element path is the one that is NOT sanitized. Safe here for a reason worth
 * stating rather than assuming: every node below is built in code, and every
 * value is a localized string or a literal — no authored content is
 * interpolated. Interpolate any, and this must go back to being a string.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-07 this comment justified the element by claiming `cleanHTML`
 * would strip the placeholder off the text input. It would not: `placeholder`
 * is in core's `input` allow-list (`common/constants.mjs:1863-1866`), `class`
 * is global (:1839-1841), and `select`/`option` keep `name`/`value`/`selected`
 * — nothing in this form would be touched. The element that lacks
 * `placeholder` is `textarea` (:1885).
 *
 * The outer div must BE a div and carry NO attributes at all — core throws on
 * each separately (dialog.mjs:188-189).
 *
 * Every value is set with `setAttribute` and never as a property. The element is
 * serialized to HTML and re-parsed, so `input.value = x` sets an IDL property
 * that does NOT reflect into the markup and arrives empty, silently — the same
 * trap the target picker's checkboxes documented.
