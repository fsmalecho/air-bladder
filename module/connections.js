 * `acquireTransport`, generation's `grantContainers`, and the socket broker that
 * runs the latter on the Warden's client for a player. A ceiling enforced only
 * in the one method all three skip is not a ceiling.
 *
 * The graph is FLAT as of 2026-08-01: every `connectedTo` points at a character.
 * That rule itself is `CairnActor#canKeepConnected` (it needs the document class
 * to state it), but it is why the counting here is simple — a keeper's subtree
 * is exactly its direct children, so there is no walk to get wrong.

 * actually go.
 *

 * flag is cleared in the same update — with ForcedDeletion, core's own
 * unsetFlag spelling (common/abstract/document.mjs:997-1003), so no residue
 * key survives to make a later reader wonder. Wrong type or a monster just
 * loses the flag: their ownership is not this automation's to touch.
 *

 * client refuses a connect unless you own both actors, but that rule lives
 * entirely in the client and `system.*` has no server wall — so a crafted
 * client can point its own npc's `connectedTo` at a stranger's PC, raise the
 * flag, and have the Warden's client sign the ownership shape for it. The
 * result is a nuisance rather than an escalation (it burns one of the victim's
 * connection slots and hands them an actor they did not ask for), but the
 * sender id is authenticated by the server and was simply unused.
 *
 * On a refusal the flag is CLEARED so a refused request cannot lurk for a
 * later pass. The ready-time catch-up sweep passes `_stats.lastModifiedBy` as
 * the requester — server-stamped, so a client cannot sign as someone else —
 * which holds the OFFLINE route (set the flag, never emit, wait for the next
 * GM load) to the same both-ends check as the live relay. Until review #9 the
 * sweep passed NO requester and this comment claimed the opposite of the code
 * beneath it: the check was decorative for exactly that route. A GM edit that
 * postdates the player's flag can still launder the id — accepted; the harm
 * stays nuisance-grade (above) and the common shape is closed. The refusal
 * does NOT undo the `connectedTo` write — the graph is client-writable by
 * design, and unpicking someone's link is a bigger decision than declining to
 * sign for it.
