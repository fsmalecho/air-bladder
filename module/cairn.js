/**
 * GM-side broker for the Actors a PLAYER's character generation grants.
 *
 * `Actor.create` needs ACTOR_CREATE, which players do not have, and granting it
 * world-wide to make one background work would let players create any actor at
 * all. So the player emits and exactly one GM client writes. This only works at
 * all because `system.json` declares `"socket": true` — the server binds no
 * handler for `system.<id>` without it and silently discards every emit, which
 * is exactly how this shipped doing nothing (review #5, critical).
 *
 * THIS IS A PRIVILEGE BOUNDARY AND IS TREATED AS ONE. Anything arriving here was
 * composed by a client we do not control: a player can emit whatever they like on
 * this socket, including a payload that is not a container at all. So the payload
 * is not trusted, it is REBUILT — only known fields are copied, the type is
 * forced, and the connection must point at an actor the SENDER can already
 * modify. Two identity rules make that check real (both learned from review #5,
 * which found the first version reading the requester out of the attacker's own
 * payload — a "guard" any player could satisfy with a GM's public user id,
 * because testUserPermission short-circuits to OWNER for any GM):
 *
 *   - WHO asked is `senderId`, the handler's second argument. Foundry's server
 *     re-emits a custom-socket event as (payload, this.user.id) with the id
 *     taken from the authenticated session — it is the one thing about the
 *     message a client cannot forge. Nothing inside `msg` names the sender.
 *   - WHAT it attaches to must be a WORLD Actor. `fromUuid` resolves more than
 *     those: an embedded Item resolves and delegates getUserLevel to its parent
 *     (so "OWNER" passes), and a compendium doc resolves too. Either would put
 *     a nonsense uuid in `connectedTo` on a document the Warden's client signed.
 *
 * Registered at init, not ready: the client buffers inbound socket events from
 * connect and REPLAYS them one line before the ready hook fires, so a listener
 * registered on ready misses anything a player sent while the GM's world was
 * still loading. `game.socket` exists from Game.connect, well before init ends.

/**
 * Persist `system.role` on every npc-typed world actor, whatever it currently
 * derives to. ONE migration doing what two used to attempt: it stamps the role
 * on pre-roles documents (which store `forHire`/`inanimate` and no role at all).
 * Until 2026-08-20 it ALSO folded `role: "hireling"` into `npc`, because a
 * `migrateData` shim substituted that on every read; the split re-admitted
 * `hireling` to NPC_ROLES, deleted the shim, and `migrateHirelingSplit` writes
 * "hireling" back onto the people it covers — so this pass stamps whatever the
 * document derives to and converts nothing (review #18 caught this paragraph
 * still describing the fold).
 *
 * **It selects on NOTHING, and that is the entire design.** Both states it fixes
 * are invisible from a running client:
 *
 *   - `migrateData` rewrites `_source` during construction (the mount→companion
 *     shim still does), so a stored legacy value and its replacement read
 *     identically — the hireling→npc shim did exactly this until the split.
 *   - `cleanData` PRUNES unknown keys out of `_source`
 *     (`common/data/fields.mjs` `#cleanKeys`), so a legacy `inanimate` sitting in
 *     the database is not there to be found either.
 *
 * That second one killed its predecessor. `migrateNpcRoles` selected on
 * `"inanimate" in _source.system` and therefore matched **nothing, ever** — it
 * ran to completion, logged nothing, and set its marker, while the key it was
 * looking for sat in the database untouched. Nobody could see it, because the
 * probe that covered it read `_source` too and read the same pruned object. It
 * only surfaced once the migration probe started planting state through the raw
 * socket and reading the raw server record back. A selection is only as good as
 * the view it selects through; this one has no selection to be wrong.
 *
 * Blind is affordable because of what `{diff: false}` does, measured against
 * 14.365 rather than assumed:
 *
 *   - It skips the empty-diff `continue` in `client/data/client-backend.mjs:262`,
 *     so the key is TRANSMITTED even though the client can see no change. A
 *     value diverged in memory (updateSource) and then written this way lands on
 *     the server and survives a reload — which is precisely this migration's
 *     shape, and it was confirmed that way before this was written.
 *   - The server still answers with a real diff, so a document that already held
 *     the same role is echoed back as `{_id}` alone: no write, no `modifiedTime`
 *     bump. Re-stamping every npc costs nothing on the ones that did not need it.
 *
 * Only `role`. `forHire` is deliberately NOT written: its schema initial is
 * `true`, which is exactly what the shim gives a converted hireling, so storing
 * it would touch every npc, mount, transport, container and monster in the world
 * to record a value they already read. The one case that needs it stored — a
 * Warden unticking the box — writes itself through the sheet. A retired
 * `inanimate` is likewise left where it lies: with `role` now stored beside it,
 * `migrateData`'s guard never looks at it again, so it is inert.
 *
 * Gated on a marker, not on state — role is a pick-list, so any state test would
 * re-stamp whatever the Warden changed away from (untick, reload, it is back).
 * The marker is set even when nothing matched, and only after the writes land:
 * a throw leaves it unset so a failed migration is retried rather than recorded
 * as done.
 *
 * World actors only, like every sibling phase. An unlinked token's delta stores
 * DIFFERENCES from its base actor, so flipping the base is enough — no
 * scene-token walk (see the spellscroll migration above for the shape that DOES
 * need one). Compendium documents are read through the same shim.

 * The NPC/Hireling split (2026-08-20): every person stored as `role: "npc"`

 * release — a Career, a For Hire box and a Day Rate — and the key is being
 * reused for the new NPC role, which has none of those.
 *
 * User ruling: EVERY one of them, not a split on `forHire`. The 2026-08-01
 * collapse demoted the hireling role to that boolean precisely so the
 * distinction survived, so `forHire ? hireling : npc` was available and was
 * deliberately not taken — a person made BEFORE that date had `forHire`
 * deleted by the 2026-07-31 migration and reads the schema initial `true`, so
 * the signal is exact only for the last three weeks of documents. Converting
 * everything means nothing on any sheet disappears and no Warden is handed an
 * NPC they did not ask for; they re-role the handful that should be.
 *
 * THIS ONE SELECTS, AND ITS SIBLINGS CANNOT. `migrateNpcRoles` and
 * `migrateMountToCompanion` are blind restamps because `migrateData` rewrites
 * their source value at initialization, so a stored "hireling" or "mount" is
 * unobservable from a client and a filter on it matches nothing, ever. Nothing
 * rewrites a stored "npc", so `_source.system.role` reads it honestly here.
 *
 * And selecting is not a nicety, it is the whole safety property: after this
 * runs, a genuine NEW npc stores exactly the value this converts. A blind
 * restamp would turn every real NPC in the world into a hireling on the second
 * pass. The marker is what stops there being a second pass, and it is set only
 * after the writes land, so a failed run retries rather than recording itself
 * done.
 *
 * DELTAS NEED THEIR OWN WALK, for the same reason the selection works. Both
 * siblings argue that unlinked-token deltas need no pass "because they store
 * differences from a base this flips" — true only while `migrateData` does the
 * flipping. It does not here, so a delta that explicitly stores `role: "npc"`
 * would keep it and the token would come back a new-style NPC while its world
 * actor is a hireling.
 *
 * WORLD COMPENDIA TOO. A Warden's own NPC pack is not in `game.actors`, and an
 * unswept one imports as the new NPC role for the rest of the world's life —
 * with the day rate still stored and no longer shown. Only world-scoped packs:
 * the system's own ship no `role: "npc"` document at all (205 monster, 11
 * companion, 4 transport, 2 container — checked), and a module's pack is not

 * Take the grant bullets back off every character that has them (user ruling

 *
 * Generation used to write one line onto a character's Background & Notes for
 * each thing a background, question or bond granted them — "Companion: Raven
 * [Question] — A Raven Familiar…" — and keep a LEDGER of exactly what it wrote
 * in `flags.mondolme.grantNotes` so a deleted beast could take its own line
 * away again. The feature is gone; the granted Actors are NOT, and are not
 * touched here.
 *
 * The ledger is what makes the removal safe, and it is the only reason this can
 * be done at all. `notes` is an htmlField the PLAYER owns, so nothing here
 * recomputes what an earlier version of the code would have written and matches
 * on that — it deletes the exact string the ledger recorded. A player who has
 * since edited a line by hand simply keeps it, which is the right way round for
 * a field that is theirs.
 *
 * NO MARKER SETTING, unlike every migration above, and the difference is real:
 * those undo states a Warden can put BACK (a role, an ownership default), so a
 * state test would re-answer the question on every load. This one selects on the
 * flag, and once the flag is gone nothing in the system writes another — the
 * state cannot recur, so a state test is exact and free.
 *
 * WHICH IS ONLY TRUE IF THE MISS OUTLIVES THE FLAG (review #15). The first
 * version pushed the notes AND the flag deletion unconditionally, so a record
 * whose string did not match lost its bullet's only description in the same
 * write that failed to use it — leaving a bullet nothing could ever find again,
 * no marker to clear, no flag to select on, and a console line reporting
 * success. The accepted case above and the unrecoverable case were the same
 * case. So a record that missed is KEPT, and whatever is left over is NAMED —
 * the shape `migrateGrimoirePages` already uses for what it cannot resolve.
 *
 * KEEPING IT IN `grantNotes` HAD NO TERMINAL STATE (review #16). That fix left
 * the record where this migration SELECTS, and skipped the write entirely when
 * nothing matched — so a total miss met the identical state on the next load
 * and warned again, and again, for the life of the world. The warning's own
 * advice could not stop it either: deleting the line by hand is precisely what
 * makes a match impossible, which is the condition that keeps it coming.
 *
 * So the two jobs are split across two flags. `grantNotes` is what this selects
 * on and it ALWAYS goes, on the single load that reads it; the records that
 * missed move to `grantNotesUnmatched`, which nothing selects on and nothing
 * ever writes again. The description stays where a person can read it, the
 * state cannot recur, and the warning is said once. The notes field itself is
 * still touched only when a bullet actually left it, so an actor nothing
 * matched on is still byte-identical afterwards.

/**
 * Flatten the connection graph and normalize connection-driven ownership —
 * Phase B of the 2026-08-01 redesign, running after the role re-stamp above.
 *
 * The FLAT rule ("every `connectedTo` points at a character") shipped with
 * the code the day before this migration; the data a world accumulated under
 * Round 2 can still say PC → hireling → sack. For each npc/hireling-typed
 * world actor with a link, walk UP from its immediate keeper with a seen-set:
 *
 *   - immediate keeper is a character           → already flat, keep it;
 *   - the chain ROOTS in a character            → re-point at that root — the
 *     sack a hireling carried belongs to the hireling's PC, which is what the
 *     table always meant by it;
 *   - npc root / dangling uuid / cycle          → clear the link and stamp
 *     `formerlyBelongedTo` with the immediate keeper's name when it still
 *     resolves — the same labelled-loot-pile shape every other break leaves.
 *
 * Ownership rides the same batch, because the shape needs the FINAL keeper
 * and only the flatten knows it (the reason this is ONE phase, ONE marker):
 * a connected non-monster takes the connected shape from its final keeper; an
 * unconnected non-monster whose STORED default is NONE is raised to LIMITED —
 * and never lowered from anything else, because a default the Warden raised
 * is a grant, and fighting the Warden's grants is exactly what the
 * transitions-only rule forbids. Monsters are untouched throughout.
 *
 * The CAP is deliberately NOT enforced here: a PC may come out of the flatten
 * keeping more than maxConnections(). The cap gates NEW connections only —
 * a migration never destroys data.
 *
 * World actors only, one batched update, marker set only after success, like
 * every sibling phase. Unlinked-token deltas inherit from their base actor;
 * no scene-token walk (see migrateNpcRoles' docblock for why not).

 * "Spellscroll" in the Create Item type list — without a spellscroll TYPE.
 *
 * Core builds that list from `Object.keys(game.model.Item)`, labelled through
 * `CONFIG.Item.typeLabels` (client-document.mjs `createDialog`), so as a TYPE only a
 * declared document type can ever appear there. Declaring one is the wrong shape for
 * the same reasons a `relic` type was: a scroll carries no data a spellbook does not,
 * and Foundry treats `type` as immutable — so a book could never be converted into a
 * scroll or back, which is the whole affordance the flag buys.
 *
 * The dialog's other seam does the job instead. Its OK handler runs
 * `FormDataExtended` over the WHOLE form and passes the result straight to
 * `cls.create()`, so a field added here reaches the new document, and
 * `CairnItem._preCreate` pins petty + one use from the flag. The extra option
 * deliberately carries `value="spellbook"`, the same as its neighbour: two options may
 * share a value, and `selectedOptions[0].dataset` is what tells them apart —
 * `select.value` cannot, and does not need to.
 *
 * The name is PRE-FILLED rather than left to the placeholder, and with the ENGLISH
 * `SPELLSCROLL_NAME` rather than the localized option label — see that constant for
 * both halves of why.
 *
 * Degrades quietly. If core reworks this dialog the option stops appearing, and the
 * worst case is a plain spellbook that the sheet's Scroll box still converts.
 *
 * Registered as a NAMED function expression so a probe can find it in
 * `Hooks.events.renderDialogV2` and switch it off in the live page — that is how
 * dev:spellscroll negative-controls this feature without editing source and
 * re-running (tools/dev/lib.mjs `withHookOff`). Renaming it breaks that probe.

 * Rewrite a damage card's flavor line to say who is attacking whom.

 * and the card simply never showed them, so the log recorded "Rolling damage
 * with Crossbow" and left the table to remember who that was aimed at.
 *
 * Resolved AT RENDER rather than at roll time, and all three reasons matter:
 * the names are read per VIEWER, BOTH producers are covered without touching
 * either (`#onRollDamage`
 * and macros.js already ship the same `data-targets`), and every damage card
 * already in the log gains the line the next time it renders. Resolving at
 * creation would freeze the sentence in the roller's language and have to be
 * written twice.
 *
 * ORDERING: must run BEFORE the player-trim below, which REMOVES `.apply-dmg`
 * from a non-GM's copy and with it the only copy of the ids. Deliberately not
 * duplicated onto the label to make that safe — a second attribute holding the
 * same data is the shape that produced years of container bugs here. The Alice
 * leg in dev:enc-damage is what guards the ordering: move this after the trim
 * and a player stops seeing the names, which that leg asserts.

/**
 * Give an UNTARGETED damage card the Apply control it never had.
 *
 * A roll made with nothing targeted shipped no anchor at all
 * (`dmg-roll-card.html`'s `{{#if (isNotNull targets)}}`), so the Warden had no way
 * to spend it from the log — and the card recorded nothing when the damage was
 * applied by hand. Everything downstream is id-driven, so the only thing missing
 * was the control and an answer to "who?"; `askDamageTargets` supplies the second.
 *
 * BUILT HERE AND NOT IN THE TEMPLATE, which is the whole point. The card's markup
 * is rendered once and STORED as the message's flavor, so a template change
 * reaches new rolls only and every untargeted card already in the log stays bare
 * forever. Injecting at render is what `nameDamageTargets` and `showDamageApplied`
 * already do, and it buys the same things: both producers are covered without
 * touching either, and tonight's log becomes spendable the moment this loads.
 *
 * NO `data-targets`. Its ABSENCE is the signal the handler reads to open the
 * picker, and an empty attribute would be a datum claiming to hold ids.
 *
 * ORDERING, and it is load-bearing twice over: this must run BEFORE
 * `showDamageApplied`, or the once-only greying looks for an anchor that does not
 * exist yet and an already-spent legacy card renders with a live control. And
 * before the player-trim, like its two siblings — the trim is what makes this
