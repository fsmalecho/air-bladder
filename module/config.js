    // The age formula: RAW Cairn 2e, 2d20 + 10 (user ruling, 2026-08-21 —
    // rules as written; the retired min-age's 21 default was an OVERRIDE,
    // and preserving it as the new default briefly happened and was reversed
    // the same day, so ages 12..20 are possible again out of the box, as the
    // book says). This is the ONE copy: the `age-formula` setting registers
    // it as its default and rollAge falls back to it when the Warden's own
    // formula is blank or invalid. A Warden who wants the old floor writes
    // the pool form {2d20 + 10, 21}kh — max(roll, 21), the hint's example;
    // the docs/dice-formulas.md guide explains the whole notation.
    // (min-age/max-age clamping is RETIRED, 2026-08-21 — issue #21: clamping
    // piled most ages onto the bound; a Warden who wants a range edits the
    // dice instead.)

// The two PERSON generators (2026-08-20 split). Both draw names from the same
// table — it is the Warden's Guide NPC name list, and a hireling has no other
// source: a 2e character takes its name from its background's name list, which
// neither of these has an equivalent of.
//
// The HIRELING's statblock is shipped runtime data (module/npc-careers-2e.json,
// the twelve 2e careers) rather than a table, so only the name is configurable
// here. The NPC's four traits and Background ARE tables, and they are the
// Warden's Guide "NPC Tables" — already shipped in warden-npcs, twenty entries
// each, and until this split only `Name` and `Faction` had a reader.
//
// These are the WARDEN'S tables and their drawn state must stay clean. The NAME
// and FACTION dice take `table.roll()`, which cannot mark anything. BACKGROUND
// and the four TRAITS go through `drawTableText` -> `table.draw()`, and that is
// safe for TWO independent reasons, both of which have to hold: every one of
// these tables is `replacement: true`, AND core skips the drawn-marking write
// entirely for a table that lives in a pack (`if (!this.replacement && !this.pack)`,
// client/documents/roll-table.mjs:109). Faction is the one that could ever be a
// WORLD table — findTableByName resolves world-first — which is exactly why it
// is on the roll() path and must stay there.

  // pair Barebones creation uses below and a 2e character uses above. The
  // Warden's Guide gives NPCs no statblock at all, which is why 10/10/10 and 6
  // HP stood here until now; a generator sitting at its schema defaults reads
  // as broken, and a rolled stranger is the answer the table actually wanted.

  // What an NPC of each Background is CARRYING (2026-08-20, user ask). The d20
  // table names positions in the world; the Barebones list of 100 names TRADES,
  // and a trade is the only background in this system that carries gear — three
  // items each. So an NPC gets the gear of its nearest Barebones counterpart,
  // through the same resolveRefs path a Barebones PC and a 2e hireling use.
  //
  // Keyed on the ENGLISH table text, and that is load-bearing: `drawTableText`
  // returns the raw result, NOT the content overlay's translation, so
  // `system.background` stores English in every language while the SHEET shows
  // `backgroundDisplay`. A map keyed on what the Warden reads would miss on
  // every non-English client. (The read/stored split, module/i18n-content.js.)
  //
  // Eleven of the twenty are the same word in both lists. Seven need a
  // translation. LORD and POLITICIAN are deliberately absent and grant nothing:
  // every one of the 100 Barebones backgrounds is an OCCUPATION, so rank and
  // office have no counterpart — which is exactly why those two words are on a
  // table the Warden rolls and not in character creation. Absent, not null, so
  // a plain lookup answers undefined and the grant is empty. Since 2026-08-21
  // absence suppresses the KIT too, at generation (buildNpcGear) AND on the
  // Background die or picker (applyNpcBackground): a Lord arrives with no
  // items at all, and landing Lord on an existing NPC unpacks the bag.
  //
  // Thug -> Highway Robber, not Thief: Thief is already row 19 of the same
  // table, so the obvious mapping would have collided. One takes by stealth,
  // the other by force.
