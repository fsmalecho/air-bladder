/**
 * Cairn's turn order, spoken by Foundry's tracker.
 *
 * Cairn has no initiative queue. At the start of combat each party member makes
 * a DEX save: pass and you act before the enemies, fail and you act after. The
 * save is rolled once when combat starts, not per round.
 *
 * Order INSIDE a bucket: the Warden may drag rows to reorder within a bucket
 * (`flags.mondolme.combatSort`, written by the tracker's drop handler,
 * read by _sortCombatants). This SUPERSEDES the same-day ruling that order
 * inside a bucket is table talk the tracker does not manage (both rulings
 * 2026-08-08, the second with the tracker in actual play) — table talk
 * survives as the default when nobody drags, since an absent flag reads 0.
 * The bucket itself stays the DEX save's outcome: changing sides is a
 * re-roll, never a drag, and the drop handler refuses across buckets.
 *
 * ACCEPTED DEVIATION (review #13, user ruling — do not re-raise): those two
 * rules bind the UI, not the database. Core grants a combatant's OWNER update
 * rights on `initiative` and `flags` outright (common/documents/combatant.mjs
 * :76-88, "the ability to update their own initiative"), so a player who owns
 * their combatant can pin their row by writing combatSort, or cross buckets
 * by writing initiative, from the console. Foundry is closed to a system
 * here — the permission test is core's own `_preUpdate`, there is no seam to
 * narrow it, and a GM-relay would break core's roll-your-own-initiative flow.
 * Accepted under the same trust-the-players house rule as the unautomated
 * mechanics: the GM-only guard on the DRAG UI is an affordance boundary, not
 * a wall, and a player rearranging the tracker by console write is table
 * behaviour for the table to police.
 *
 * The buckets are encoded as initiative 1 / 0 / −1, which the fork-era version
 * of this file already did and which is the part worth keeping: core's sort is
 * descending with an id tiebreak (documents/combat.mjs:565-569), so the three
 * values order themselves and every existing combat in every world already
 * holds them — no migration. What was wrong was the execution:
 *
 *  - it called super.rollInitiative and then PATCHED the results, one awaited
 *    `combatant.update()` per combatant — N+1 writes, each re-running
 *    setupTurns();
 *  - core SKIPS combatants the calling user does not own
 *    (documents/combat.mjs:402), leaving `initiative` null, and the patch loop
 *    then evaluated `null <= DEX` — which is TRUE, so a save that was never
 *    rolled counted as a pass;
 *  - the bucket was read off token disposition alone, so a PC on a neutral or
 *    secret token joined the enemy slot;
 *  - the log said "rolls for Initiative — 14": the right die wearing the wrong
 *    label, with the DEX it was tested against stated nowhere.
