/**
 * Shared gear resolution for Mondolme.
 *
 * Gear is the single editable source of truth: it lives in Item compendia that a
 * Warden can unlock and edit. Character generation (2e AND Barebones), hireling
 * loadouts, bonds, and the marketplace all reference an item BY NAME and resolve
 * it here — so editing a pack item once flows everywhere it is granted.
 *
 * This is the resolve-time half. The author-time half (turning an inline
 * {name, tags, uses, ...} record into an item's type/system fields) is
 * `buildGearItem`, kept here too so the two halves stay in one place; the
 * tools/import/gear-2e.mjs authoring script carries a byte-identical copy of that
 * inference (Node can't import this browser module across the ESM/CJS boundary,
 * so the copies are kept in sync by hand — see the note there).
 *
 * Nothing here touches Foundry globals at module load; `game`/`foundry` are read
 * only inside resolveGearItem's body.
