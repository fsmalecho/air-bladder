/**
 * The Faction generator — a Warden-only button that composes the SRD faction
 * tables (Setting Seeds, CC BY-SA 4.0) into a JournalEntry dossier. The first
 * JournalEntry this system mints: a faction is campaign machinery, not an
 * Actor, and a chat card would scroll away.
 *
 * Every roll resolves BY NAME, WORLD FIRST (findTableByName), so a Warden who
 * has replaced or edited any of the tables feeds the generator their own
 * content automatically — the same contract as the NPC sheet's Faction die.
 * roll(), never draw(): these are the Warden's tables and a draw would dirty
 * their drawn state (the config.js invariant).
 *
 * The loop closes by hand, deliberately: when a rolled faction earns a place
 * in the campaign, the Warden adds its name as a row in their world
 * "Warden: NPC - Faction" table — and the sheet die starts dealing it to NPCs
 * and Monsters. The generator invents candidates; the Warden's table is the
 * canon. Clicking again mints another dossier; nothing is ever overwritten.
