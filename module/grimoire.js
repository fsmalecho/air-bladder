 * included, before this module existed):
 *
 * - `[1] … [2] …` blocks: when bare-digit markers are present, the block
 *   matching the invested dice replaces them (the text before the first
 *   marker is kept as preamble). No block for this power — or no markers at
 *   all — leaves the whole text standing: harmless when absent.
 * - `[sum]`, `[dice]` (and Malecho's Spanish `[dado]`) substitute the rolled
 *   values, and arithmetic like `[sum*10]` EVALUATES — but only when, after
 *   substitution, nothing but digits and arithmetic remains. Anything else
 *   (`[8 HP, 3 STR…]` stat blocks, the odd stray bracket the verbatim
 *   transcription preserves) is left exactly as written. A value that DID
 *   resolve is wrapped `<span class="grimoire-resolved" data-tooltip="[expr]">`
 *   so the card marks it as dice-made rather than authored prose, the original
 *   expression a hover away.
 *
 * Runs on whatever text it is handed, and both callers matter now: the STORED
 * card resolves the English source, while the rendered one resolves the
 * viewer's overlay copy — so a Spanish client reads a Spanish sentence
 * carrying the same numbers. Translating BEFORE substituting is the only order
 * that works: the overlay is keyed on the authored English, which `[sum*10]`
 * stops being the moment a rolled 12 has been written into it.
