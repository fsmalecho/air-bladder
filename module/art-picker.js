/**
 * The one art picker.
 *
 * Every image control in the system opens this: a character's portrait, an
 * NPC's, a container's, and an item's. It used to be three near-copies of the
 * same 140-line dialog (`_pickPortrait`, `_pickContainerArt`, and core's plain
 * FilePicker on item sheets), which is why the Game-Icons gallery could not
 * simply be "added to the picker" — there was no picker, there were three.
 *
 * A caller says WHICH galleries apply and what to do with the chosen path; the
 * dialog, tabs, URL row and Browse escape are the same everywhere.
 *
 * The galleries:
 *
 *   classes    the container Kind glyphs. Picking one is not picking a picture,
 *              it is saying "this is a barrel" — so its cells carry a class key
 *              and the caller gets it back.
 *   shipped    Jon Aspeheim's character portraits (CC BY 4.0). Human faces, so
 *              a Monster is not offered them.
 *   custom     the Warden's own folder, from the world setting. Shown whenever
 *              it has images, or to any GM (who can put some there).
 *   gameicons  2,275 game-icons.net glyphs (CC BY 3.0), browsed CATEGORY FIRST:
 *              38 folder tiles, then that category's thumbnails. The grids are
 *              built on demand — rendering all 38 at once is 2,275 <img> in one
 *              dialog, and only one category is ever on screen.
 *   tlomdev    tlomdev's token drawings (CC BY-SA 4.0), browsed category-first
 *              exactly like gameicons: the artist's own folders, plus
 *              Kettlewright's copies under "kettlewright-portraits".
 *   lydia      Lydia Comer's monster art, drawn for Air Bladder (© Lydia Comer,
 *              all rights reserved — NOT Creative Commons). A flat grid like
 *              `shipped` rather than a folder tree: 17 creatures is one screen.
 *              PAIRED like `shipped` too — picking sets the matching token.
 *
 * Every gallery that has a licence shows its credit under its own grid, never
 * globally: a credit under the wrong art is worse than none. Lydia's makes that
 * load-bearing rather than tidy — hers is the one grant here that is not a
 * public licence, and a viewer who reads the CC BY-SA line under tlomdev's grid
 * must not be able to read it as covering her drawings too.

  // Measured in a real session (2026-08-01): sheet z-112, picker z-113, a second
  // sheet z-114 ON TOP of the picker, second picker z-115. That is the whole of
  // the "clicking the portrait does nothing, but it works on the second click"
  // report — the first click's dialog was never gone, only buried, and clicking
  // again just stacked another one on top of it. For two documents whose sheets
  // happened to sit exactly where the dialog spawns, no click ever appeared to
  // work at all.
