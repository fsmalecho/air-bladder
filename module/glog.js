/**
 * GLOG Magic (the official Cairn hack, cairnrpg.com/hacks/glog-magic/) — the
 * OVERRIDING half. When `enable-glog-magic` is on, only GLOG and custom spells
 * are used (user ruling 2026-08-05): generation's spell grants resolve against
 * the GLOG pack and the custom set with canon excluded, every granted spell
 * lands as a SPELLSCROLL ("found magic is a scroll you copy into your
 * grimoire"), and — the total-conversion ruling — FLIPPING THE SETTING ON
 * SWEEPS THE WORLD: every canon spellbook becomes a GLOG spellscroll, every
 * canon scroll's text swaps to the GLOG wording, everywhere. The invariant
 * afterwards, which the probe asserts: no canon spell text exists anywhere in
 * the world. Flipping OFF converts nothing back, accepted at ruling time —
 * generation reverts to canon and existing GLOG scrolls simply remain.
 *
 * The sweep converts what EXISTS at flip time; what ARRIVES afterwards is
 * converted by CairnItem._preCreate calling glogConversionDiff (2026-08-09
 * ruling: there are no spellbooks in GLOG — only Grimoires, their pages, and
 * spellscrolls). Before that seam, a compendium drag landed exactly as
 * stored, which is how a post-flip drop of Haste stayed a book.
 *
 * The Grimoire itself (the flag-marked item, the cast flow) lives in
 * grimoire.js and item.js; this file is only the setting's reach into CONTENT.
