 *
 * The dialect is an ARGUMENT, never read from the setting here (the
 * `damageFormulaFor` rule: nothing in this function reads a setting or an
 * actor). It matters because the two dialects disagree about what "keep
 * highest" is spelled like:
 *
 *  - Cairn notation ON:  `d6 + d6` — the die-plus-die form the rewrite claims.
 *  - Cairn notation OFF: `{1d6,1d6}kh` — with the rewrite off, `d6 + d6` is
 *    ARITHMETIC, so emitting it would say "keep highest" on the control and
 *    roll a sum, silently, at any table that turned the setting off.
 *
 * A mixed-size SUM can never use `+` in the Cairn dialect — both terms are
 * bare dice, so the rewrite would claim `d6 + d8` as keep-highest. The pool
 * form `{1d6,1d8}` is the one notation that means mixed-sum in both dialects:
 * a bare PoolTerm sums its kept rolls (dice/terms/pool.mjs:13-15, :122-129).

 *
 * The FIRST button shows the WEAPON's own die, so a d6 weapon offers d6 / d4 /

 * button also carries that die's Font Awesome glyph — see `dieIcon`.
 *

 * with the copy and so was the action string, so there is one word for the
 * concept everywhere; a key reading `.Normal` under a button reading "Standard"
 * is the kind of drift a translator has no way to resolve.
 *
 * DialogV2 notes, all three of which this repo has paid for:
 *   - Buttons carry `action` and NO callback. `DialogV2` resolves a button to
 *     `(await callback(...)) ?? button.action` (dialog.mjs:273), so a callback
 *     returning null is indistinguishable from no callback at all. Having none
 *     means the resolved value is exactly the action string, with no trap to
 *     step in.
 *   - Nothing is built in JS and handed to `content`: DialogV2 serializes it to
 *     innerHTML, so listeners on constructed nodes are dead on arrival. The three
 *     choices ARE the dialog's buttons.
 *   - `rejectClose: false`, so dismissing resolves rather than throwing.
 *   - `icon`, `class` and `tooltip` are all supported per button
 *     (dialog.mjs:227-246), so the decoration below needs no custom markup and
 *     stays clear of `content` entirely.
 *
 * ORDER: STANDARD, impaired, enhanced (user ruling 2026-08-07), superseding the
 * first cut's "impaired → standard → enhanced is the scale the rule is described
 * in". The default leads, which is where the eye starts and where autofocus
 * already sat. It also closes a latent trap: `isDefault` falls back to
 * `(i === 0) && !buttons.some(b => b.default)` (dialog.mjs:228), so with Impaired
 * at index 0, dropping `default: true` would silently have made IMPAIRED the
 * button Enter presses.
 *
 * @param {String} standardFormula  the weapon's die, shown on the first button
 * @param {String} [weaponName]  the item the roll came from, named in the title.
 *   Verbatim and never re-localized, for the reason the card's weapon datum is:

 * ATTACKER as her own victim. That is not bad luck: the gesture that PRECEDES a
 * damage roll — opening a combatant's sheet, usually by double-clicking its token
 * — SELECTS the roller. So the heuristic was biased toward exactly the wrong
 * answer, and most reliably wrong in the commonest case.

 *
 * Concealment is `nameableTokens`, not a second test. A GM is above every gate in

 * Unwrapping the `<p>` ProseMirror always adds is cosmetic — an inline description
 * panel does not want a block. **The cleaning is not**, and it is why this stopped
 * being called `stripPar`: it was two literal `.replace()` calls and nothing else,
 * a name that sounds cosmetic on a helper that is now load-bearing for security.
 *
 * The case it was built for: `system.features[]`, an `ArrayField(ObjectField)`,
 * while the Features UI existed (removed 2026-08-09; the field survives, unrendered).
 * `htmlFields` in `system.json` addresses TOP-LEVEL SCHEMA PATHS: the server has no
 * schema for the interior of an ObjectField, so it can never sanitize what is stored
 * in there no matter what the manifest declares. A player writing raw HTML into a
 * feature description on their OWN character therefore had it stored byte-for-byte
 * and injected into the GM's DOM — a player→GM XSS, observed end-to-end 2026-07-30,
 * the same escalation as the declared-field hole closed the day before and NOT
 * fixable the same way. The feature sink is gone; the weapon crit/description
 * panel (actor-sheet.js) is the caller that keeps this load-bearing, and any
 * future array-interior render must come through here too (field-audit.mjs
 * refuses the alternative).
 *
 * Cleaning at the SINK is the whole fix. Filtering our own dialog would be theatre:
 * the attacker owns the browser that writes the document and can call
 * `actor.update()` directly.
 *
 * `foundry.utils.cleanHTML` is core's own allow-list cleaner
 * (`client/utils/helpers.mjs:15`) — tags from `ALLOWED_HTML_TAGS`, attributes from
 * `ALLOWED_HTML_ATTRIBUTES`, which admits no `on*` handler and no `<script>`, and
 * validates URL schemes on href/src/cite. Core uses it for exactly this shape of
 * injection (`chat-bubbles.mjs:212`, `tooltip-manager.mjs:251`).
 *
 * Every caller assigns the result to `innerHTML` or tests it for emptiness, so this
 * stays ONE function rather than a safe variant beside an unsafe one — there is then
 * no unsafe helper left for future code to reach for by mistake.
 *
 * **The unwrap happens on the DOM, never on the string, and that is the whole
 * security property of this function.** The first version kept `stripPar`'s two
 * `.replace()` calls and ran them on `cleanHTML`'s SERIALIZED output, which
 * `innerHTML` then re-parses — and string surgery between a serialize and a parse
 * promotes inert text into live markup. `<iframe>` is an allowed tag whose content
 * is RAWTEXT, so the cleaner sees the inside as a single text node, copies it
 * untouched, and serializes it unescaped. That let a stored
 * `<iframe></ifra<p>me><img src=x onerror=…>` survive cleaning with its `<p>`
 * intact; deleting that `<p>` spliced `</ifra` + `me>` into `</iframe>`, ending the
 * frame early and turning the trailing `<img>` into a live element. Observed
 * executing in the GM's client through this exact sink, 2026-07-30, with the
 * unstripped string as the control. Unwrapping the first paragraph ELEMENT is
 * equivalent for every well-formed input and cannot splice anything, because the
 * output is re-serialized from a parsed tree rather than edited as text.
