/**
 * System data models — the replacement for `template.json`.
 *
 * Foundry 14 deprecated `template.json` and REMOVES it in V16 (the server already
 * files a `packages.warnings` entry, so every installed user sees a warning badge
 * on the Setup screen today). Sub-types are now declared in `system.json` under
 * `documentTypes`, and their shape lives here as `TypeDataModel` subclasses
 * registered on `CONFIG.Actor.dataModels` / `CONFIG.Item.dataModels` at `init`.
 *
 * Two things to know before editing a schema here:
 *
 * 1. **A schema is strict.** A field that is written but not declared is dropped
 *    on the next write, silently — no error, no console warning. That is the only
 *    real hazard in this file. `tools/dev/field-audit.mjs` diffs every persisted
 *    `system.*` path (sheet `name=`/`target=` bindings plus `update()`/`create()`
 *    literals in `module/`) against these schemas; run it after any change here.
 *
 * 2. **Derived values are NOT declared and must not be.** `prepareData` assigns
 *    around thirty computed properties onto `this.system` (`slotsUsed`, `encumbered`,
 *    `armor`, `coinsPerSlot`, `containerObjects`, …). Assigning a non-schema property
 *    onto a DataModel instance is the documented Foundry pattern; `toObject()`
 *    serialises schema fields only, so derived values correctly never persist.
 *    Declaring one would turn it into stored state and reintroduce the
 *    stored-vs-derived collision that cost us the Hit Protection data-loss bug.

/**
 * The one discriminator on the non-player model (see docs/npc-roles-plan.md).
 * Replaces `forHire` (gated the day rate) and `inanimate` (hid the stat block):
 * two independent booleans could say "for-hire inanimate chest"; one role field
 * cannot express nonsense. Order here is the sheet's pick-list order.
 *
 * **`hireling` IS BACK (2026-08-20), and `npc` now means something else.** It
 * was retired on 2026-08-01 on the reasoning that being for hire is not a
 * different KIND of person, only a fact about one — true of the two roles as
 * they then were, which shared a sheet, a stat block, a generator and a career
 * table and differed in whether one row rendered. What was missing was the
 * third thing: an NPC the party MEETS, who has a Background rather than a
 * Career and whose Quirk, Goal, Virtue and Vice come off the Warden's Guide
 * NPC tables. Once that exists the two are genuinely different kinds of
 * person, and the collapse's own argument stops applying.
 *
 * So the key is RESTORED rather than invented: `hireling` meant exactly this
 * before the collapse, and a world that never ran the 2026-08-01 migration
 * still stores it. Everything that was role `npc` becomes `hireling` — see
 * `migrateHirelingSplit` in cairn.js — and `npc` is reused for the new role.
 *
 * TWO CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL BITE IF FORGOTTEN. The `migrateData` conversion
 * of stored "hireling" is GONE from below, and its removal is load-bearing:
 * left in place it would flip every write that migration makes straight back
 * on the next read. And because nothing rewrites a stored "npc", that value IS
 * observable in `_source` — unlike "hireling" and "mount", whose migrations
 * had to be blind. The split migration therefore selects, and MUST: after its
 * marker is set, a genuine new NPC stores "npc" too.
 *
 * `forHire` stays. It is redundant with role `hireling` and is kept anyway —
 * retiring it is a second migration for nothing a user could see. The
 * `hireling` TYPE also stays registered (ids are immutable) and stays hidden
 * from Create Actor.
 *
 * **`mount` EVOLVED into `companion` (2026-08-08, user ruling).** The role was
 * never really about riding — the generator already mapped every one-off
 * granted beast to it — and the canon backgrounds grant companions nobody
 * rides (Fletchwind's falcon, Half Witch's raven). Same retirement machinery
 * as hireling's: `migrateData` converts stored "mount" on read, the world
 * migration in cairn.js restamps on write, and the pack YAML was rewritten by
 * its importer in the same commit.

 *     Quirk / Goal / Virtue / Vice off the Warden's Guide NPC tables.
 *
 * Both keys are on one schema because a schema cannot vary by role, so an NPC
 * still STORES a `dayRate` of 0 and a hireling still stores a blank
 * `background`. Neither is shown, and that is the whole difference.
 *
 * The union is deliberate rather than minimal: the 205 shipped monsters are `npc`
 * documents and 204 of them carry `system.description`, so the merged sheet keeps
 * the Description tab a hireling sheet never had. Dropping it would have made

   * written. The one-time world migration (cairn.js) persists the value and
   * deletes the two retired keys; until it runs, this shim is the truth.
   *
   * **`migrateData` RUNS ON UPDATE DIFFS, not only on whole sources.** Measured
   * against 14.365: `NpcData.migrateData({containerClass: "pile"})` comes back
   * `{containerClass: "pile", role: "npc"}`, and that injected key lands in the
   * write. So a condition of the shape "field X is absent" is not a statement
   * about the document — in a diff, everything the caller did not touch is
   * absent.
   *
   * That bit, and this is the fix (2026-07-31, found by rewriting
   * `dev:item-pile` onto the Kind control). The guard used to include
   * `|| source.containerClass`, so ANY update touching the Kind and not also
   * naming the role re-derived one — and `deriveNpcRole` reads `inanimate`,
   * which a modern document does not have, so it answered "npc". Setting a
   * crate's Kind demoted it to a plain NPC: stat block back, gold counter
   * back, capacity rules gone. The art picker did it too (`_setContainerArt`
   * writes `{"system.containerClass": cls}` and nothing else), so choosing a
   * barrel picture for a barrel silently un-made it. The sheet's own submit was
   * the one path that was safe, because the role `<select>` rides along in it —
   * which is exactly why this survived: every manual test went through the sheet.
   *
   * The guard now demands a RETIRED key — `inanimate`, and only it. `forHire`
   * was named here too until 2026-08-02, on the same "written by nothing any
   * more" reasoning, which stopped being true the day the hireling role
   * collapsed and gave it back to the sheet. See the guard itself for what
   * that cost. `inanimate` is written by nothing modern, so its presence is
   * unambiguous evidence of a whole pre-roles source rather than a diff. What
   * that gives up is a pre-roles
   * document that stored a `containerClass` and NEITHER flag, which would have
   * derived `mount` for a mount class; it takes the schema initial instead. The
   * shipped packs all state their role outright, and the world migration
   * selects on type + legacy keys + dayRate, never on this.

   still holds one". No world does: the built migration converted the dev world's
   containers to npc before it was removed, and :30001 is a fresh branch install.
   What kept it alive was therefore nothing, while the create dialog went on
   OFFERING it — Foundry lists every registered subtype and there is no manifest
   flag to hide one — so the Warden's own Create Actor button still minted
   documents against the retired model, complete with the retired sheet's

   the owner-side `containers` uuid array on CharacterData/NpcData, the other
   half of the same two-way link (see CairnActor#connectedActors, which had
   promised exactly that: "that half goes away with `keeper` itself").
   `transportKind` outlived this on the `transport` ITEM type, which the
   item-type rewrite has since retired too — see the note where TransportData
   used to be, below.

   HirelingData is gone the other way — folded into NpcData above, which the
   `hireling` type still points at (see ACTOR_DATA_MODELS). That one IS an alias
