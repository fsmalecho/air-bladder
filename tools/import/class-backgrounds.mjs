/**
 * Author the "Backgrounds for Cairn" set — the shipped CUSTOM background pack.
 *
 *   node tools/import/class-backgrounds.mjs [--dry]
 *
 * SOURCE. "Backgrounds for Cairn" by Gordon McCormick (text CC BY-SA 4.0; based
 * on Cairn by Yochai Gal and BECMI D&D by Frank Mentzer), supplied by the
 * project owner as a PDF on 2026-08-04. Unlike the other importers this one
 * cannot fetch its source at run time — there is no machine-readable upstream —
 * so the text is transcribed INLINE below and this file is the artifact of
 * record, the same standing game-icons.mjs has for its hand-curated download.
 * The PDF's ART (Perplexing Ruins, Jeff Koch) is NOT covered by the text
 * licence and nothing of it is used; items wear the same type icons the rest
 * of background-items wears.
 *
 * WHAT IT WRITES.
 *   - src/packs/backgrounds-custom/   7 `background` Items, system.source "2e"
 *     (they ride the 2e generation path — "custom" means NOT in the Player's
 *     Guide, and the CUSTOM content toggle is what admits the pack).
 *   - src/packs/background-items/     the set's one-off grant items. Anything
 *     the pool already has (Chainmail, Bow, Sedative, "Pole, 10ft"…) is
 *     REFERENCED, never re-authored — the gear-pool duplicate gate exists
 *     because two copies of one name is how grants start resolving at random.
 *   - src/packs/more-spellbooks/      ONE spellbook, "Shield" (BECMI; the only
 *     granted spell Cairn lacks). more-spellbooks is already the extended
 *     non-SRD set, and "Spellbook (X)" grants resolve against the spell packs,
 *     so it cannot live in the background pack.
 *
 * TRANSCRIPTION RULES, so a diff against the PDF is explainable:
 *   - Taglines, questions, option prose and the ten names are verbatim.
 *   - "3d6 Gold Pieces" gear lines are DROPPED — the 2e generator rolls gold;
 *     no shipped background lists it either.
 *   - The Dwarf's first table is headed "What is special about your Axe (d8)?"
 *     with the axe itself implied: rows 1–5 therefore grant Axe, and row 6
 *     ("it's not an axe") grants Warhammer instead. Same pattern as the
 *     Fletchwind, whose bow comes from its wood table.
 *   - The Halfling's "extra 3d6 Gold" stays PROSE — bonusGold is a fixed
 *     number and rolling it is the player's to do (house rule: no automation
 *     of mechanical text).
 *   - The Halfling's Faery Mark is a body marking, not inventory: prose only.
 *   - One typo corrected: "Crytal Prism" → "Crystal Prism" (Magic-User).
 *
 * IDs are derived from the document name via a tiny FNV-ish hash, so reruns
 * are byte-identical and never orphan a character's backgroundUuid.
 * Idempotent. Rebuild afterwards: npm run build:packs (stop Foundry first).
