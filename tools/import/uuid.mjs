/**
 * Build the `documentUuid` a RollTable result needs, for the importers that
 * generate tables (marketplace, transports, barebones).
 *
 * Foundry v13 replaced a result's `documentCollection` + `documentId` pair with a
 * single `documentUuid`, and the old fields are shims removed in v15
 * (common/documents/table-result.mjs:102-123). The importers were still emitting
 * the pair — and `type: pack`, which v13 merged into `type: document`
 * (common/constants.mjs:954-964) — so every table they generated arrived in a
 * shape that only loads because `BaseTableResult.migrateData` rewrites it.
 *
 * The document type is read from `system.json` rather than guessed, because
 * Barebones tables reference BOTH items and other RollTables and the uuid differs
 * ("…mondolme.weapons.Item.xyz" vs "…mondolme.tables-barebones.RollTable.xyz").
 * Guessing "Item" produced a uuid that resolves to nothing, which is a broken gear
 * grant with no error attached to it.
