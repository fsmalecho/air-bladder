/**
 * Propose game-icons art for compendium ITEMS still on a default class icon.
 *
 *   node tools/import/item-art.mjs             # propose, write nothing
 *   node tools/import/item-art.mjs --apply     # write img into src/packs
 *   node tools/import/item-art.mjs --all       # reconsider every item, not just bare ones
 *   node tools/import/item-art.mjs --pack tools --pack weapons   # limit to some packs
 *
 * Sibling of ./monster-art.mjs and the same bargain: A FIRST PASS, NOT AN ORACLE.
 * 179 items across seven packs share six class icons between them — every weapon
 * is `weapons.svg`, every tool is `tools.svg` — so the compendium browser is a
 * wall of identical thumbnails. Assigning them by hand is hours; reviewing a
 * proposal in the world, where the art is actually visible, is minutes. Anything
 * it cannot match confidently is reported UNMATCHED and LEFT on its class icon: a
 * bad guess costs more to find and undo than a blank does to fill.
 *
 * Items already carrying gallery art were chosen by hand and are skipped, and
 * learned from, exactly as the monster pass does.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT monster-art.mjs WITH A DIFFERENT DIRECTORY. Two inversions:
 *
 *   1. ENGLISH COMPOUNDS ARE HEAD-FINAL, and monster names are not. A monster is
 *      stored "Genus, Species" and the SPECIFIC half carries the picture, so that
 *      matcher searches most-specific-first. An item is a noun phrase whose LAST
 *      word is the thing: a Skull Whistle is a whistle, a Wraith Lantern is a
 *      lantern, Gate Chalk is chalk. Search the head noun first and the modifier
 *      last, or every reliquary relic becomes a picture of its adjective.
 *
 *   2. THE CATEGORY BIAS FLIPS. There a non-creature folder needed an exact hit;
 *      here a CREATURE folder does. Without it "Gate Chalk" lands on
 *      `body/chalk-outline-murder` — a real token match, a confident score, and a
 *      murder scene on a piece of chalk.
 *
 * A third difference is smaller but bites: item names carry PARENTHETICAL
 * EXAMPLES ("Bathing Goods (Soap, Perfume, etc.)"). Those are the best hint in
 * the name — the head noun "goods" pictures nothing — so they are searched, but
 * after the phrase itself, since they are instances rather than the thing.
 *
 * HOW MUCH OF THIS IS THE ALGORITHM, HONESTLY. Run `--search-only` and the
 * matcher answers 83 of the 179 alone, of which roughly half are right: it is
 * good at a name that IS a thing ("Torch", "Manacles", "Lockpicks") and bad at
 * everything else, because a 27-category general icon set does not contain a
 * gambeson and will happily offer `shields/air-force` for an Air Bladder. So the
 * OVERRIDES table carries most of the load here, and that is the nature of the
 * corpus rather than a defect in the search.
 *
 * It is worth saying because the first cut hid it. The table had grown to cover
 * all 179 names, every proposal read "override", and the search had become
 * unfalsifiable — code that could have been deleted with no visible effect. The
 * 42 entries that merely restated what the search already found are gone, and
 * removing them changed not one proposal. What is left is 120 judgements a
 * person can argue with, which is the only thing a table like this should hold.
