/**
 * Consolidate the "special" background-granted items into one pack.
 *
 * Most gear items are standard kit filed by mechanical type (armor, weapons, …).
 * But the 2e/Barebones backgrounds also grant ~260 distinctive one-off items
 * (Alchemical Sigils, Catring, Twin daggers, Homunculus…) that were scattered
 * across the type packs by their type, cluttering "Armor" with 13 oddments and so
 * on. This relocates every item granted by EXACTLY ONE background (and by nothing
 * standard) into src/packs/background-items/. Generic gear that several
 * backgrounds share (Hammer, Shovel, Short sword…) stays in the type packs.
 *
 * Safe because resolution is BY NAME across CANONICAL_GEAR_PACKS (module/gear.js)
 * and an item's TYPE lives on the item, not the pack — a moved armor item is still
 * armor. background-items MUST be listed in CANONICAL_GEAR_PACKS or grants of the
 * moved items resolve to nothing.
 *
 * This is a POST-IMPORT step, like item-icons.mjs / table-icons.mjs: run it after
 * backgrounds-2e.mjs / barebones.mjs (which re-author gear into the type packs),
 * then `npm run build:packs`. Idempotent — an item already in background-items is
 * left alone, and a stray re-authored duplicate in a type pack is removed in
 * favour of the canonical copy.
 *
