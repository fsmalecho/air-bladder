/**
 * Import the curated game-icons.net collection into game-icons/.
 *
 *   node tools/import/game-icons.mjs --src <dir> [--dry]
 *   node tools/import/game-icons.mjs --add <dir> [--dry]  (one category, keep the rest)
 *   node tools/import/game-icons.mjs --restamp [--dry]   (shipped tree, no download)
 *
 * Unlike its sibling `icons.mjs`, this one is NOT reproducible from the network:
 * its input is a hand-curated download, so which icons ship is a decision, not a
 * query. That makes `art/game-icons/` and `art/game-icons/CREDITS.md` the artifacts of
 * record — they are committed, and a rerun only ever needs to happen when the
 * curation changes. Point --src at the unpacked game-icons.net download.
 *
 * SOURCE SHAPE (what the site's archive gives you):
 *
 *   <src>/<category>/icons/<fg>/<bg>/1x1/<artist>/<icon>.svg
 *   <src>/<category>/icons/license.txt
 *
 * SHIPPED SHAPE (what the picker browses):
 *
 *   game-icons/<category>/<icon>.svg
 *
 * The flatten is the whole point — a Warden picking art should see thumbnails
 * under a category, not drill through a folder per artist. But it throws away
 * the one thing CC BY 3.0 requires, because **the artist is encoded ONLY in the
 * source path**. So the credits table is built from the source tree BEFORE the
 * copy, and `art/game-icons/CREDITS.md` is the attribution: lose it and the
 * collection is no longer licensed to ship.
 *
 * COLLISIONS. Within a single category the same filename can arrive from two
 * different artists (13 of them do — `animals/horse-head.svg` is both Lorc's and
 * Delapouite's). A naive flatten drops one and mis-credits the survivor, which
 * is a licensing error, not just a lost file. Colliding names are therefore
 * suffixed with the artist (`horse-head-lorc.svg`); names that do not collide
 * are left clean, because those are what the picker shows.
 *
 * Writes:
 *   game-icons/<category>/*.svg
 *   art/game-icons/CREDITS.md            per-icon CC BY 3.0 attribution
 *   art/game-icons/license.txt           upstream notice, verbatim
 *   module/game-icons-manifest.json  category -> filenames, for the picker
 *
 * The manifest exists for the same reason portrait-manifest.json does: a client
 * cannot enumerate a server folder without FILES_BROWSE, and players pick art.
 *
 * `--add`: ADDING ONE CATEGORY WITHOUT THE OTHER DOWNLOADS
 *
 * `--src` is a whole-collection rebuild — it wipes game-icons/ and writes back
 * only what the source tree holds. That is correct when you still have every
 * category's download, and useless when you do not: by 2026-08-03 exactly three
 * of the twenty-four survived on disk, so re-running it to add one category
 * would have silently dropped twenty-one.
 *
 * `--add <dir>` takes the same per-category download shape and MERGES it, by
 * reconstructing the existing categories from what is committed:
 *
 *   the SVG files       -> game-icons/<category>/*.svg  (already size-stamped;
 *                          withIntrinsicSize is idempotent, so they survive
 *                          a rewrite untouched)
 *   the artist + slug   -> art/game-icons/CREDITS.md, which is the ONLY record of
 *                          either (the flatten discards the artist, and this
 *                          file says so). Recovered from each row's source URL,
 *                          https://game-icons.net/1x1/<artist>/<slug>.html.
 *
 * That reconstruction is exactly why CREDITS.md has to stay one row per shipped
 * file: it is not just the attribution any more, it is the input that lets the
 * collection be extended at all. `--add` asserts the two agree before writing,
 * because a credits file that has drifted from the tree would silently
 * mis-attribute every icon it rebuilt.
 *
 * The source shape is per-category, so <dir> is the PARENT of the category
 * folder — the same thing --src wants. Categories already present are refused
 * rather than merged: re-importing one means resolving collisions against a
 * flattened tree whose artist suffixes are already baked in, and getting that
 * subtly wrong is a licensing error. Delete the folder and use --src for that.
