/**
 * Author the Mounts & Transports ACTOR pack — every mount, vehicle and worn
 * container as an NPC document, in folders — plus the shop table that
 * references them.
 *
 *   node tools/import/mounts.mjs [--dry]
 *
 * THE ONLY TRANSPORT IMPORTER. There used to be two: transports.mjs authored
 * `transport` Items into a shipped `transports` pack, and this file derived NPC
 * Actors from those Items. The Item pack was the old model's home — a thing
 * with slots as an Item, its stat block as PROSE — and once the Actors carried
 * the real fields it was pure leftover: 13 of its 15 documents were superseded
 * and the compendium sat in the sidebar beside the Actor pack showing stale
 * horses. The user's words: "I don't understand why this is still here and I
 * don't want to see it. I don't want this in the 1.9 release." So the Item
 * pack is GONE (dropped from system.json, src/packs/transports deleted,
 * transports.mjs deleted), and everything it did lives here.
 *
 * WHAT IS HERE. Three folders, fifteen documents:
 *   Containers  Backpack, Sack — the worn shapes. These were deliberately NOT
 *               documents while the Item pack shipped ("a Warden makes one by
 *               picking the class"), but the shop has to reference SOMETHING
 *               to sell, and with the Item rows gone the only honest home is
 *               here — which is also the folder layout the user originally
 *               asked for (Containers / Mounts / Transports).
 *   Mounts      Mule, Horse, and every beast a 2e background grants (the six
 *               Outrider breeds, the Kettlewright/Bonekeeper donkey…).
 *   Transports  Handcart, Cart, Wagon, Burial Wagon.
 *
 * BACKGROUND BEASTS are read straight out of src/packs/backgrounds-2e (so the
 * two can never drift) — each an editable document a Warden can retune, NOT
 * stocked by the shop: you cannot buy a Rivertooth, you roll one. Their stat
 * blocks ("8 HP, 1 Armor") are parsed from the granting option's prose; the
 * prose itself stays beside them as the description (house style: no
 * automation of mechanical text).
 *
 * HP RULE. Stated HP is written; an INANIMATE thing with none is written 0/0
 * explicitly — "author nothing" is not "no HP", NpcData defaults hp to 6/6 and
 * that phantom 6 surfaces the moment anyone unticks Inanimate. A beast with no
 * stated HP keeps the schema default on purpose. `armor` is DERIVED every
 * prepare; `armorOverride` is the field that holds a stated Armor.
 *
 * ART is stamped at authoring time via module/icons.js (the same classifier
 * the runtime uses), which item-icons.mjs proved Node can import. This file
 * used to inherit whatever art the source Items carried at read time, which
 * made it order-dependent on item-icons.mjs — a rerun in the wrong order
 * silently regressed all thirteen icons to Foundry-stock webp. Authoring the
 * icon directly kills that trap.
 *
 * VALUES. Cairn 2e's core book is not open; these are the authoritative OPEN
 * numbers from the Barebones Edition marketplace, as tuned in the fork and
 * signed off there: Horse +4/75gp, Mule +6/30 (slow), Cart +4/30 (bulky),
 * Wagon +8/200 (slow), plus Backpack/Sack/Handcart. Defaults, not scripture —
 * the point of this pack is that a Warden can change them. "Slow" and "bulky"
 * live in the prose now; the npc schema has no such fields and the sheet
 * automates nothing.
 *
 * Run order: barebones.mjs -> marketplace.mjs -> THIS -> table-icons.mjs.
 * marketplace.mjs wipes the whole marketplace table dir, so it must run first
 * or it deletes the shop table written here. Rebuild afterwards:
 * npm run build:packs (stop Foundry first).
 *
 * Re-runnable and byte-stable: both dirs' own docs are rewritten from scratch
 * and every id is a sha256 of a fixed seed, so a rerun with unchanged input
 * produces no diff.
