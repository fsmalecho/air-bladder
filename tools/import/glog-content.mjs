/**
 * The GLOG Magic RULES content: the Mishaps table and the player journals
 * (ruling 15, 2026-08-05; journals extended 2026-08-10 by user ask) —
 * `tables-glog` (RollTable) and `journals-glog` (the system's FIRST
 * JournalEntry pack; packs are single-type, so the pair is two declarations).
 * `journals-glog` ships TWO entries:
 *
 *   - "GLOG Magic — Player Rules": the hack's rules page, plus a "Magical
 *     Mishaps" page carrying the mishap table annotated with EXACT odds per
 *     cast (computed here by enumeration, per dice count — several rows are
 *     unreachable below a given count and say so) and a risks-by-dice table
 *     (any-Fatigue chance, average Fatigue, mishap chance).
 *   - "GLOG Magic — Spells": the full spell list, read FROM the generated
 *     src/packs/spellbooks-glog so it can never disagree with the documents
 *     it describes. Cross-linked with the rules journal both ways.
 *
 *   node tools/import/glog-content.mjs [--dry]
 *
 * Source: cairnrpg.com/hacks/glog-magic/ — CC BY-SA 4.0, stated on the page,
 * covered by the same attribution row as the GLOG spells. No machine-readable
 * upstream, so the transcription below is the artifact of record, VERBATIM
 * including the page's own typos ("One your hands becomes fused", "Both age
 * at at the rate", "call on it for aide") — the glog-spells.mjs standard: fix
 * nothing, or a diff against the page reads as our editing. The odds
 * annotations and the risk table are OURS, appended in italics and credited
 * as such on the page.
 *
 * The Mishaps table is a LOOKUP: the caster's [sum] (2–24) picks the row.
 * Its stored formula is 2d12 — the one dice expression whose range is exactly
 * 2–24 — so core's draw button functions, but the description says out loud
 * that the sum from the cast is what consults it. The ROLLTABLE rows stay
 * verbatim — the cast whisper quotes them; odds live in the journal only.
 *
 * Run order: AFTER glog-spells.mjs — the spell-list journal reads
 * src/packs/spellbooks-glog, so a spells rerun must precede this one.
 * Idempotent: both pack dirs are OURS entirely and wiped whole, ids are
 * seed-hashed.
