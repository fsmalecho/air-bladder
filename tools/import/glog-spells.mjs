/**
 * The GLOG spell pack: 100 spellSCROLLS into src/packs/spellbooks-glog/
 * (labelled "GLOG Spellscrolls" — under GLOG there are no spellbooks, so the
 * pack ships every spell in scroll form; 2026-08-09 ruling, made when a
 * dragged Haste landed as a book).
 *
 *   node tools/import/glog-spells.mjs [--dry]
 *
 * Source: https://cairnrpg.com/hacks/glog-spells/ — "The text on this page is
 * licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0" (stated on the page; same for the companion
 * rules at /hacks/glog-magic/). The list is the CANON 100 re-worded to scale
 * with the GLOG Magic hack's casting variables: [dice] is the number of Magic
 * Dice invested, [sum] their total. 96 entries carry one or both; 4 carry
 * neither, and two of those (Sniff, Hear Whispers) are byte-identical to the
 * canon wording — which is exactly why the GLOG wording is a SEPARATE document
 * with `system.glog: true` rather than a second description field: the two
 * texts cannot be derived from each other in either direction.
 *
 * The page has no machine-readable form, so like class-backgrounds.mjs the
 * transcription below IS the artifact of record. [dice]/[sum] stay literal in
 * the text — mechanical prose is never automated. Transcription is verbatim,
 * typos and all ("[dice] objects is covered…"): the text is the licensed work,
 * and correcting it is not this importer's call.
 *
 * Own-vs-foreign: a file whose gearSource flag is not "glog-spells" is FOREIGN
 * and respected; our own previous output is overwritten so a rerun can fix a
 * field it got wrong (the lesson class-backgrounds.mjs paid for). IDs are
 * FNV-ish hashes of the name, prefixed "GS", so reruns are byte-identical.
 * Idempotent. Rebuild afterwards: npm run build:packs (stop Foundry first).
