/**
 * Build the Lydia Comer gallery — her monster art, offered in the portrait
 * picker on NPC and Monster sheets.
 *
 *   node tools/import/lydia-comer.mjs [--src <dir>] [--dry]
 *   node tools/import/lydia-comer.mjs --to-webp      (re-encode the shipped tree)
 *
 * UNLIKE its siblings `game-icons.mjs` and `tlomdev.mjs`, this gallery is a
 * PAIRED one: every creature ships twice, as a square portrait and as the
 * circle-cropped token drawn from it, exactly like Jon Aspeheim's
 * character_portraits/ + character_tokens/. That is the whole reason it is a
 * gallery of its own rather than another tlomdev-shaped category tree — a
 * tlomdev pick is its own token because there is no square to pair with, and
 * Lydia's circles have black corners that make a poor `actor.img`.
 *
 * SOURCE SHAPE (`--src`, ingest mode):
 *
 *   <src>/<Name>.jpg     the square drawing            -> portraits/
 *   <src>/<Name>.png     the circle-cropped token      -> tokens/
 *
 * Pairing is BY STEM, not by filename — the halves arrive in different formats,
 * and the SOURCE is still read that way. Every stem must have both halves; a
 * lone file is a hard error, never a skip, because a missing token ships a
 * portrait whose token silently falls back to the black-cornered circle, and a
 * missing portrait ships nothing at all.
 *
 * WEBP, AND WHY THAT WAS A LICENCE DECISION BEFORE IT WAS A TECHNICAL ONE.
 * Everything ships re-encoded to WebP q95 since 2026-08-04. Until that date this
 * file said "her grant forbids modifying the artwork, so nothing here
 * re-encodes", and that was correct at the time: the grant then in force said
 * the artwork may not be modified, and re-encoding under it would have been a
 * licence breach dressed up as an optimisation. The artist has since rewritten
 * the grant (`art/lydia-comer/license.txt`) and the current text sets no bar on
 * altering the artwork at all — it bounds USE instead, to Air Bladder and to
 * representing the project.
 *
 * So the reason nothing here crops, rescales or recolours is now HOUSE PRACTICE,
 * not a licence term. Keep it anyway. It is someone's original artwork, the
 * artist is reachable, and "the licence would let us" is a poor answer to give
 * her. What it is NOT any longer is a rule this file may cite as external.
 *
 * q95 rather than the usual q80-85: at q95 the average pixel moves less than
 * 1/255 (PSNR 46-50 dB) and the gallery still loses 54% of its weight, 15.8 MB
 * down to ~7 MB. It is someone's original artwork, and the ~1.3 MB that q90
 * would have saved is not worth spending on it.
 *
 * Lossless was measured and rejected: it is the WRONG tool for the square half.
 * Those arrive as JPEG, so a lossless re-encode faithfully preserves their
 * existing compression artifacts and the file gets BIGGER — 592K to 672K on the
 * largest. Lossless only pays on the PNG circles.
 *
 * SHIPPED SHAPE (what the picker browses):
 *
 *   lydia-comer/portraits/<Name>.webp
 *   lydia-comer/tokens/<Name>.webp
 *   lydia-comer/CREDITS.md            the gallery's contents + attribution
 *   module/lydia-manifest.json        pairs, for the picker
 *
 * Both halves are now the same extension, so the manifest's `pairs` could in
 * principle be a bare name list the way portrait-manifest.json is. It stays a
 * pair list: the runtime lookup already reads it, changing the shape buys
 * nothing, and a gallery whose two halves live in different folders is exactly
 * where a "they must match" assumption goes unnoticed until it does not.
 *
 * With NO --src it re-validates the shipped tree and regenerates the manifest
 * and CREDITS.md from it — the tree is its own source of truth, so a rerun is
 * safe and needs no download. (game-icons.mjs `--restamp` exists for the same
 * reason: an operation that is a pure function of the shipped files should not
 * depend on finding the original download again.)
 *
 * IT NEVER TOUCHES lydia-comer/ ITSELF, only the two subfolders. The parent
 * holds the LOGO — Airbladder01/02/06.webp, exactly the three the README and
 * `tools/site.mjs` use by name; the unused variants (03, 04, and the 07.jpg
 * wordmark) were removed 2026-08-04 by user ruling — and her licence grant.
 * tlomdev.mjs rmSyncs its whole output folder; doing that here would delete
 * the logo, the licence and the site's header image. Airbladder* is excluded
 * from ingest by name for the same reason — a wordmark is not a creature.
 *
 * The manifest exists for the same reason portrait-manifest.json does: a client
 * cannot enumerate a server folder without FILES_BROWSE, and players pick art.
