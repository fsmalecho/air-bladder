/**
 * Import tlomdev's token drawings into tlomdev/.
 *
 *   node tools/import/tlomdev.mjs --src <dir> --kw <dir> [--dry]
 *
 * Like its sibling `game-icons.mjs`, this is NOT reproducible from the network:
 * `--src` is the unpacked itch.io download of "Tlomdev's Tokens"
 * (https://tlomdev.itch.io/tlomdevs-tokens) and `--kw` is a folder holding the
 * portrait files from the Kettlewright repo
 * (https://github.com/yochaigal/kettlewright, app/static/images/portraits).
 * `tlomdev/`, its CREDITS.md/license.txt and module/tlomdev-manifest.json are
 * the artifacts of record — committed, rerun only when the inputs change.
 *
 * SOURCE SHAPE:
 *
 *   <src>/<category>/<name>.png        the itch pack, one folder per category
 *   <kw>/portraitN.webp                Kettlewright's copies of the same
 *                                      artist's drawings, plus
 *                                      default-portrait.webp
 *
 * SHIPPED SHAPE (what the picker browses):
 *
 *   tlomdev/<category>/<name>.png              category names kept VERBATIM
 *   tlomdev/kettlewright-portraits/<name>.webp
 *
 * Category folder names are the artist's own, kept verbatim (including the
 * spaces in "human-npcs-for-itmod") — display labels are localized via
 * CAIRN.TlomdevCategory.* instead of renaming folders. The Kettlewright files
 * keep KETTLEWRIGHT'S exact names because the Kettlewright importer maps a
 * stock portrait pick by that numbering (portrait17.webp) — rename one and the
 * import of a character wearing it silently loses its face.
 *
 * One artist, one licence (CC BY-SA 4.0), so unlike game-icons there is no
 * per-file attribution problem and no collision handling: each category is one
 * flat folder from one person.
 *
 * Writes:
 *   tlomdev/<category>/*.png|webp
 *   tlomdev/CREDITS.md            attribution + provenance
 *   tlomdev/license.txt           the licence notice that must travel with the art
 *   module/tlomdev-manifest.json  category -> filenames, for the picker
 *
 * The manifest exists for the same reason portrait-manifest.json does: a client
 * cannot enumerate a server folder without FILES_BROWSE, and players pick art.
