/**
 * Propose game-icons art for monsters that are still on the default class icon.
 *
 *   node tools/import/monster-art.mjs            # propose, write nothing
 *   node tools/import/monster-art.mjs --apply    # write img + token art into src/packs
 *   node tools/import/monster-art.mjs --all      # reconsider every monster, not just bare ones
 *
 * A FIRST PASS, NOT AN ORACLE. It exists because assigning 163 monsters by hand
 * through the picker is hours of work, and a decent proposal turns that into
 * review-and-override — which is minutes, and can be done in the world where the
 * art is actually visible. Anything it cannot match confidently is reported as
 * UNMATCHED and left on its class icon rather than given something wrong: a bad
 * guess costs more to find and undo than a blank does to fill.
 *
 * The 42 monsters already carrying gallery art are skipped by default, because
 * those were chosen by hand and a machine should not overrule them.
 *
 * MATCHING. Monster names are stored "Genus, Species" ("Cat, Lion", "Dragon,
 * Blue"), and the SPECIFIC half carries the picture — a Lion is a lion before it
 * is a cat. So the comma-parts are searched most-specific-first, then the whole
 * name, then individual words. A glyph slug scores on how squarely it answers
 * the keyword: an exact slug beats "<keyword>-head", which beats a prefix, which
 * beats containing the word at all. Category order breaks ties toward the
 * folders that hold creatures rather than the ones that hold tools.
