/**
 * `system.role` — the one discriminator on the NPC sheet (docs/npc-roles-plan.md).
 *
 * Role replaced the For Hire and Inanimate checkboxes: transport/container hide
 * the stat block (HP, STR/DEX/WIL, Armor, Deprived/Panicked, the Rest / Restore /
 * Die-of-Fate buttons and every derived condition) while KEEPING the name,
 * inventory and tabs; only a FOR-HIRE npc shows the day rate; monster loses the
 * Connections tab outright. Since Round 2, GOLD follows the role too: mounts and
 * things hide the counter while the stored value survives.
 *
 * Things here that are correctness, not cosmetics:
 *
 * 1. **The derived conditions.** `_computeStatContext` reads `dead = STR <= 0`,
 *    which is exactly the value a crate sits at, so without the isThing guard the
 *    sheet announces that a barrel is Dead, Paralyzed and Delirious at once.
 *
 * 2. **The role select must not be one-way.** It is deliberately OUTSIDE every
 *    block it hides — pick Container and the select must survive to pick back.
 *
 * 3. **The FLAT graph and the cap (2026-08-01).** Keeping is a TYPE privilege:
 *    only a character keeps, so every edge runs PC → non-character and the
 *    npc→npc nesting Round 2 allowed is refused at connect time. ONE upward
 *    link ever (connectActor itself refuses a connected target — the picker
 *    filter alone never covered a drop), at most `maxConnections()` children
 *    per keeper counting every role, and ownership follows a PC → NPC connect
 *    while a PC child's is never touched.
 *
 * 4. **The conditional tab resets tabGroups.** Standing on Connections and
 *    switching the role to Monster removes the tab under you — the sheet must
 *    land on a rendered tab, not a blank body.
 *
 * 5. **Tab ORDER (2026-08-01) and the person-role INITIAL (2026-08-21).**
 *    Description still leads the npc sheet's nav and panels, but a fresh
 *    PERSON-role sheet (npc, hireling) OPENS on Items — the PC's default,
 *    asked for — while a monster still opens on Description. The initial
 *    takes a `tabGroups` override because core seeds the group from static
 *    TABS at construction. The character-sheet leg stops a "reorder both"
 *    regression and doubles as the order-reader's differential witness.
 *
 * 6. **Both directions, either end — ONE verb, player-usable (2026-08-01).**
 *    A connected actor's tab shows its upward keeper as a line breakable from
 *    the child end; an unconnected connectable shows Connect (attach ME).
 *    Connect/break is the Warden's always, or the OWNER OF BOTH ENDS' — so
 *    the player leg INVERTED: Alice's direct calls on her own pair now land
 *    end-to-end (link written, sync flag relayed, the GM client answering
 *    with the exact ownership shape), and the fail-witness became the
 *    one-end-foreign differential — a sack she does not own refuses her,
 *    which only the both-ends term can be refusing.
 *
 * Drives the real select so `submitOnChange` commits it the way a user does.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROLS, in-page: `_computeStatContext` runs with the actor's
 * `isThing` shadowed false for the duration of the call — a zero-STR container
 * must then show the Dead banner again. The header-gap leg restores the pre-fix
 * `margin-top: 2px` inline and the dead band between HP/Gold and STR/Armor must
 * come back, or the flush-foot assertion is not load-bearing.
 *
 * Usage: npm run dev:roles   (establishes Alice itself if dev:players has not run)
