/**
 * Reserved per-category custom portrait folders (issue #18, fsmalecho) — e2e.
 *
 *   npm run dev:portrait-categories   (dev world on :30000, which runs the working tree)
 *
 * A folder named `pc`, `npc`, `monster` or `companion` at the top level of the
 * Warden's custom portrait folder becomes that category's auto-assignment pool.
 * The rule lives in one helper (`customPoolFor`), but the CATEGORY is a literal
 * at each call site, so a probe that only exercised the helper would pass while
 * every generated NPC drew from `pc/`. Every leg below therefore goes through
 * the real creation path — Actor.create for a hand-made npc, createMonster for
 * a monster, grantContainers for a beast — and only the pool-shape assertions
 * read the helper directly.
 *
 * Three planted roots, because the interesting cases are about what is ABSENT:
 *
 *   zz-pcat-full   pc/ npc/ monster/ companion/ + one loose image
 *   zz-pcat-mon    monster/ + one loose image     (the exclusion ruling)
 *   zz-pcat-flat   faces/ + one loose image       (no reserved names at all)
 *
 * The two negative ones matter most. `zz-pcat-mon` proves the general pool
 * EXCLUDES the reserved folders: without that, a Warden who had sorted only
 * their monster art would find every player character generated wearing it —
 * the feature making things worse for the one category they had bothered to
 * file. And `zz-pcat-flat` proves monsters and companions do NOT inherit the
 * general pool: they have never drawn from it, and a Warden with an unsorted
 * folder of faces must not wake up to monsters wearing them.
 *
 * FilePicker has no delete API, so the planted folders survive the run by
 * design; the uploads overwrite, so a re-run is idempotent. The setting and
 * every actor this creates ARE restored, and the restore is asserted.
