/**
 * Background-granted containers: four 2e backgrounds hand out a beast or a
 * vehicle — from a choice table (Kettlewright's donkey, Bonekeeper's burial
 * wagon, every one of Outrider's six horse breeds) or outright in their starting
 * gear (the Mountebank's cart). A container is an Actor, so it cannot ride in
 * items[] — it is minted once the character exists. This probe proves the whole
 * path.
 *
 *   node tools/dev/bg-container-probe.mjs   (needs Foundry running, world launched)
 *
 * Steps, driven headless as GM:
 *   1. Every container name the background pack grants has an editable npc
 *      Actor in the `mounts-transports` pack — the pack grantContainers
 *      resolves against — and none of them is stocked by the shop.
 *   2. Generating an Outrider mints a container Actor keeper-linked to the
 *      character, with the capacity the rolled option specified, kind `mount`,
 *      and the buyer's ownership. A mount costs its keeper no slots.
 *   3. Regenerating replaces it — the old one is gone, exactly one remains — and
 *      a container the PLAYER made (no grantSource flag) survives untouched.
 *   4. Re-rolling just that question swaps the beast and leaves the rest alone.
 *   4b. A background can also grant a container OUTRIGHT rather than from a
 *       choice table (the Mountebank's cart). That is a separate code path and
 *       2e generation originally missed it, so it is asserted too.
 *   5. Editing the pack document flows into the next character generated.
 * Exits non-zero on any failed assertion or console error.
