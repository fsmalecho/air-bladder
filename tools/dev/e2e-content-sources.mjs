/**
 * The content-source toggles actually govern which backgrounds a character is
 * generated from.
 *
 *   npm run dev:content-sources     (needs Foundry running, world launched)
 *
 * The bug this exists for (issue #9): `generate2eCharacter` read the shipped pack
 * inline — `game.packs.get("mondolme.backgrounds-2e")` — instead of going
 * through `getBackgroundsFor("2e")`. Only the picker and `changeBackground` used
 * the union, so RANDOM generation ignored both toggles: a Warden running a
 * homebrew-only game (shipped off, custom on) got shipped backgrounds and their
 * own were never rolled. Nothing errored, and the settings sheet showed exactly
 * what they had asked for, so it read as a settings bug rather than a generation
 * one.
 *
 * Note what a weaker probe would have missed. Asserting only the SIZE of the pool
 * passes in three of the four cases below whichever code is in place, and
 * asserting only that "a character was generated" passes in all four. The
 * assertion that bites is which background the generated character actually came
 * out with, in the custom-only case, with a real custom background present — so
 * this probe creates one in a world pack rather than assuming the world has any.
 * The dev world had none at all, which is why the first reproduction showed the
 * empty-pool fallback and hid the bigger defect underneath it.
 *
 * Restores every setting it touches and deletes the pack it makes.
