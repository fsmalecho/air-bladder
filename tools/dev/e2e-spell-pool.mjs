/**
 * The random-spell pool: canon-only, index-first, and never a full pack load.
 *
 *   npm run dev:spell-pool     (needs Foundry running, world launched)
 *
 * Two rulings this gates (2026-08-05):
 *
 *   1. Random spells and spellscrolls in generation draw from the CANON pack —
 *      `mondolme.spellbooks` — and never from More Spellbooks. Stated by the
 *      user with "100% certainty"; the draw pool and the by-name grant list
 *      (SPELL_PACKS) are deliberately separate constants so widening one cannot
 *      silently widen the other.
 *
 *   2. The draw is INDEX-FIRST: read the (core-maintained, always-live) pack
 *      index, pick, fetch ONE document. The old shape memoized getDocuments()
 *      across both packs and never invalidated — a spell added to an unlocked
 *      pack mid-session was undrawable until reload, silently — and
 *      getDocuments() is a server round trip on EVERY call (~1.7s warm for 20
 *      docs), so the memo was also the only thing keeping it usable.
 *
 * The draw RESULT is correct under either implementation, so asserting on it
 * alone cannot fail. Leg 1 therefore asserts WORK DONE (full pack loads
 * observed while drawing — must be zero), with an in-page negative control: a
 * probe-local closure that reproduces the old load-everything shape and must
 * trip the same counter. Never a source edit.
 *
 * Leg 2's canon-only assertion needs More Spellbooks to be non-empty to mean
 * anything — with nothing outside the canon pack, "only canon came out" is
 * vacuous — so it asserts that precondition out loud instead of assuming it.
