 * probe's `page.evaluate`: on 2026-07-29 `age-override-probe` set `min-age` to 99
 * to test the age floor, then threw on the next line (an AppV2 casualty —
 * `sheet._onRollAge` had stopped existing). Its restore sat *after* the throw,
 * inside the same evaluate, so it never ran. The setting stayed at 99 in the dev
 * world, and from then on EVERY character generated aged 99 and the age re-roll
 * looked broken — it was flooring to 99 too, so the value never visibly changed.
 * The user hit it as a system bug hours later.
 *
 * An exception inside `page.evaluate` propagates into Node, so a Node-level
 * `finally` still runs when an in-page one would have been skipped. Anything a
 * probe changes about the world it shares with a human belongs in that finally.
 *
 * Restores by diffing against the snapshot, so it touches only what actually
 * moved, and reports what it put back — a silent repair would hide a probe that

 * `Hooks.off` takes either the id or the function, so the feature can be switched off
 * in the live page, asserted absent, and switched back on — seconds, one session, and
 * the repo is never dirty.
 *
 * The alternative cost real time and left a hazard: stubbing `module/cairn.js` and
 * re-running meant a full browser launch per direction, and when the harness killed
 * one run mid-flight the stub stayed in the working tree. Same reasoning as
 * `withSettings` above — the restore belongs in a Node-level `finally`, where a throw
 * inside the page cannot skip it.
 *

 * function expression. That is deliberate: matching on `fn.toString()` would silently
 * stop matching the day the implementation is reworded.
