 *
 * A RollTable result of type `document` carries a `documentUuid`. If that uuid
 * names nothing, the table still LOOKS fine — it draws, it prints the item's name
 * to chat, and the generator quietly grants nothing. There is no error, no
 * warning, and no way for a player to tell the difference between "you rolled a
 * Wig" and "you rolled a Wig and received it".
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: 16 of the 100 rows on Barebones: Creation - Additional
 * Gear pointed at items that did not exist (2026-07-28). They had been authored
 * and then removed by a later consolidation pass, which had no way to know a table
 * still named them. Rolling any of those 16 gave the player nothing at all.
 *
 * No Foundry required — this reads src/packs YAML directly, so it is cheap enough
 * to run on every content change. Exits non-zero on any dangling reference.

 * whole family — createHireling, generateHireling, hirelingToActorData and the
 * rest — because a stale branch or a copy-paste from the fork could bring one
 * back and it would still PARSE: the import would resolve to nothing at

 * live exports again, and a gate that fails on live code is not a gate, it is
 * an obstacle — the one thing this repo has repeatedly paid for is a red check
 * with nothing wrong behind it, because that is what teaches the override
 * reflex.
 *
 * What remains is what is still genuinely dead, and stays dead: the old data
 * FILE (`hirelings-2e`, now `npc-careers-2e.json`), its reader
 * (`getHirelings2e`, now `getNpcCareers2e`) and the config key that pointed at
 * it (`hirelingGenerator`, folded into `npcGenerator`). Those three are what a
