/**
 * Phase 3 acceptance probe: the marketplace is a REFERENCE catalog over the
 * editable gear pool, so editing a pool item's cost/description updates the shop.
 *
 *   node tools/dev/marketplace-probe.mjs   (needs Foundry running, world launched)
 *
 * Steps, driven headless as GM:
 *   1. Read the shop via module/marketplace.js getMarketplaceCatalog(); assert the
 *      three categories resolve every reference (Weapons 15, Armor 6, Gear 49) and
 *      that prices are read off the items (Dagger 5, Plate Mail 60), plus a bundle
 *      with its rename nudge.
 *   2. Edit the pool Dagger in place (cost → 99, stamp a description marker) with
 *      the pack unlocked, re-read the catalog, assert the shop reflects BOTH edits.
 *      Revert.
 *   3. Buy flow: a temp character buys the Dagger (gold deducted, item added) and
 *      Takes a bundle for free (added, gold unchanged). Clean up.
 *   4. A FULL PACK cannot shop (2026-08-05 ruling). Shopping is ordinary
 *      acquisition — overflow is owed to what generation grants and to Fatigue,
 *      never to a purchase — and this path was the last holdout: it created the
 *      item and warned afterwards, so buying was the one way past the limit. At
 *      exactly 10/10 both buttons are greyed, and forcing `disabled` back off
 *      and clicking is STILL refused: the greying is the affordance, `acquire`
 *      is the enforcement, and a dialog left open while the pack filled must not
 *      be a way through. Transports and petty items stay available (neither
 *      costs the buyer a slot). Control: free one slot and the buy lands again.
 *
 * Two traps this probe pays for, both of which made step 4 pass or fail for the
 * wrong reason before they were found:
 *   - `foundry.applications.instances` is a **Map**, so the `Object.values()`
 *     close loop was a silent no-op. Every dialog stayed open, and with two live
 *     shops `document.querySelector` answered from the stale one.
 *   - The buttons must be read only after `refresh()` has run. Polling for
 *     `.mkt-row` returns as soon as the dialog renders, and every button is then
 *     in its TEMPLATE state — enabled, whatever the pack holds. The header slot
 *     readout is rendered empty and filled by refresh(), so it is the signal.
 * Exits non-zero on any failed assertion or console error.
