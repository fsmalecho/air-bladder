/**
 * Two ORDERINGS on the background-drop path. Both are about *when* the question is
 * asked, not about what the drop does — `dev:bg-drop-guard` already covers that.
 *
 *   1. THE PLAYER ONE. `_onDropBackground` shows its destructive confirmation
 *      ("change this character's background to X? this deletes its granted gear")
 *      before `changeBackground` reaches `canRegenerateContainers`. That guard
 *      refuses a non-GM whose character HOLDS granted containers — containers are
 *      Actors and Foundry gates Actor deletion on ASSISTANT. So a player was asked
 *      a destructive question the code could never honour, said yes, and got a
 *      warning and no change. (It once refused on a display SETTING instead of on
 *      what the character carried; that coupling, and the setting, are both gone —
 *      so this leg now checks the setup actually granted a container, rather than
 *      arranging a world flag and assuming.)
 *
 *   2. THE REORDER ONE. The background intercept sits at the very top of
 *      `_onDropItem`, above the same-actor branch. A background sitting in the
 *      inventory — the 0.1.7 artefact that upgraded worlds still carry — is a
 *      draggable row like any other, so DRAGGING IT TO REORDER IT raised the
 *      destructive prompt, and a GM answering yes wiped the character's granted
 *      gear. The gesture is a sort, not a swap.
 *
 * The GM cannot reproduce (1) and a player cannot conveniently be given a world to
 * wreck for (2), so this runs two sessions: `joinAsGM` for the setup and the reorder
 * leg, `joinAs(page, "Alice")` for the player leg. Run `npm run dev:players` first.
 *
 * Both legs run twice, the second time with the fix neutralised IN PAGE:
 *   - (1) swaps `_mayChangeBackground` on the prototype to a constant `true`. That
 *     method IS the fix, so replacing it restores the old order exactly, and the
 *     refusal still arrives from `changeBackground`'s own guard downstream — which
 *     is the defect: asked, then refused.
 *   - (2) shadows `actor` on the dropped item so the new `item.actor !== this.actor`
 *     term is false, which is literally the pre-fix condition. No second copy of
 *     either method exists to drift out of step with the real one.
 *
 * World state (two settings, and every actor created here) is restored from NODE in
 * a finally, never from inside a page that may have died mid-evaluate.
 *
 * Usage: npm run dev:bg-drop-order
