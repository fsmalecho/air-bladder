/**
 * Container-link permission e2e — review finding 13.
 *
 * Attaching a container USED to be two writes: the keeper listed the container's
 * uuid and the container's `keeper` pointed back. `createOwnedContainer` did them
 * in order with no permission check and no catch, so a player dropping a
 * Warden-owned container onto their own sheet got the first (they own their
 * character) and a refusal on the second — leaving the character listing a
 * container with an empty `keeper`: unopenable, and still claimable by anyone
 * else. The link is ONE write on the child now, and the `container` type that
 * carried the other half is retired (2026-07-31), so the half-applied state is
 * structurally unreachable. The refusal itself still has to hold, and this still
 * asserts it — against an npc mule, which is what a Warden's mule is now.
 *
 * MUST run as a real PLAYER. A GM passes every ownership check AND every Warden
 * gate, so a GM session cannot reproduce this no matter what it drops.
 *
 * Also asserts the legitimate path still works: with ACTOR_CREATE granted, a
 * player buying a transport gets a fully linked container. That is the case a
 * careless permission guard would break, because `acquireTransport` copies
 * ownership onto the container only AFTER creating it.
 *
 * Usage: npm run dev:container-link   (needs Alice — npm run dev:players)
