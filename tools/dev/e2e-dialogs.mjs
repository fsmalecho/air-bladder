/**
 * One-off probe: the sheet dialogs ported from V1 Dialog to DialogV2 — add
 * item and the regenerate confirm (the add/edit-feature pair went with the
 * Features UI, 2026-08-09; this probe now asserts the Features section is
 * ABSENT, against planted stored data, and that the data survives).
 *
 * Each one used to reach through the V1 callback's jQuery argument
 * (`html[0].querySelector("form")`). DialogV2 hands the callback the clicked
 * BUTTON instead, and renders content inside its own <form> -- so a nested
 * <form> in the content template would be dropped by the parser and
 * `button.form` would resolve to the wrong thing (or the class would vanish).
 *
 * Drives real clicks, not programmatic calls, because the whole point is that
 * the button/form wiring is correct in the DOM.
