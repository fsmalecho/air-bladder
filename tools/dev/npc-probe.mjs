/**
 * NPC acceptance probe: prove that a generated NPC is a faithful copy
 * of one of Cairn 2e's twelve example statblocks, and that its gear is a live
 * COPY of the editable pool -- the same reference guarantee as a character's
 * starting gear, not a second inlined loadout.
 *
 *   node tools/dev/npc-probe.mjs     (needs Foundry running, world launched)
 *
 * Steps, driven headless as GM:
 *   1. Load the shipped catalogue; assert 12 statblocks, all gear by-name refs
 *      (a `tags` key would mean the inline shape crept back in).
 *   2. Create an NPC; assert its profession/day-rate/HP/abilities match its
 *      book statblock exactly, and that every gear reference resolved into an
 *      owned item tagged grantSource "profession".
 *   3. Assert derived Armor equals the statblock's printed Armor -- which only
 *      holds if the armor pieces resolved from the pool AND were equipped.
 *   4. Edit a pool item the NPC carries; re-roll the profession until it
 *      comes back round to that statblock, and assert the edit flows through.
 *   5. Profession re-roll replaces only profession-tagged gear: a GM-added item
 *      survives.
 *   6. Name re-roll changes the name and leaves the statblock alone.
 *   7. Render the sheet and check the merged NPC layout: a Description tab exists,
 *      NO Features section renders there (the Features UI went 2026-08-09 —
 *      asserted against planted stored data, which must survive), that tab holds
 *      exactly ONE editor (the description -- notes belong on the Notes tab), the
 *      portrait opens the picker, and no checkbox is left on Foundry's own styling.
 *   7b. CLICK the portrait, because a present `data-action` proves only that the
 *      attribute is there: it must really open the gallery.
 *   8. NPC-role sheet parity (2026-08-01): a generated NPC arrives with an age
 *      and eight traits, and BLANK pronouns (2026-08-20 ruling — they were a
 *      uniform pick of three until then); all of them — plus scarEnabled and a
 *      picked scar —
 *      ROUND-TRIP through the real sheet (written via the form, read off the
 *      document, surviving a re-render). Witness: the same write path drops an
 *      UNDECLARED sibling key, so the greens are load-bearing on the NpcData
 *      declarations rather than on Foundry keeping whatever it is handed.
 *   9. Identity is kept by omission: profession and name re-rolls leave
 *      pronouns/age/traits alone (seeded with sentinels first, so "unchanged" is
 *      observable), while regenerateHireling — a whole new person — replaces age
 *      and traits and CLEARS the pronouns the last one carried.
 *  10. The role gate: the biography block is ABSENT on a monster, a mount and a
 *      container-role npc, present on the person from step 8. Witness in-page:
 *      `_prepareContext` patched to force showBiography on a monster, and the
 *      block must appear — proof the absence assertions can fail.
 *  11. Career → day-rate autofill (CairnActor._preUpdate): a known career name
 *      fills a still-zero rate (case-insensitively); a non-zero rate is never
 *      overwritten; an explicit dayRate in the same update wins; an unknown name
 *      fills nothing. Witness: the base class's _preUpdate shadowed onto the
 *      instance (the autofill removed, nothing else), and the same known-name
 *      write must leave 0.
 *  12. Revert the pool item and delete the test actors.
 * Exits non-zero on any failed assertion or console error.
