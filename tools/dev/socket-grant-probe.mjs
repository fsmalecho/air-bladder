/**
 * Socket grant broker e2e — review #5, criticals 1 and 2.
 *
 * A player's character generation cannot mint the Actors a background grants
 * (ACTOR_CREATE is not theirs), so grantContainers emits on the system socket
 * and the Warden's client writes. Two ways that shipped broken, both invisible
 * from a GM session:
 *
 *   - `system.json` never declared `"socket": true`, so the server bound no
 *     handler and silently discarded every emit. No error anywhere; the horse
 *     simply never appeared. The POSITIVE path here is the gate for that line:
 *     it can only pass when the server actually relays.
 *   - The handler read the requester out of the attacker's own payload
 *     (`msg.userId`) instead of the server-authenticated second argument. Any
 *     player could pass a GM's public user id and testUserPermission would
 *     short-circuit to OWNER — the guard was a no-op. Attack 1 proves the
 *     forged id is now ignored; attack 2 proves an embedded-Item uuid (which
 *     resolves, and delegates ownership to the parent) is refused as a
 *     connection target.
 *
 * MUST run as a real PLAYER for the positive path (a GM never takes the socket
 * branch — the exact reason the defect shipped: every probe joined as GM), and
 * the server must have been RESTARTED since system.json gained "socket": true —
 * the server reads the manifest at startup only, so an un-restarted edit looks
 * exactly like no edit.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL, in-page: re-register the OLD handler's logic alongside the
 * fixed one and replay both attacks — the old code mints both actors, proving
 * the refusals above are load-bearing and the attacks well-formed, in seconds
 * rather than by reverting source. `game.socket.off` removes it afterwards.
 *
 * Usage: npm run dev:socket-grant   (needs Foundry running; establishes Alice
 * itself if dev:players has not run)
