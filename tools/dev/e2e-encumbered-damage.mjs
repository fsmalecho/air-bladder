/**
 * The damage flow, end to end: the encumbered-HP data-loss bug, and the chat
 * card's Apply-damage button.
 *
 *   npm run dev:enc-damage        (dev world on :30000, which runs the working tree)
 *
 * _prepareCharacterData zeroes system.hp.value whenever an actor is encumbered or
 * panicked. Two code paths then read that DERIVED zero and persisted it:
 *
 *   1. damage.js applyToTarget — read hp, compute, actor.update(). With hp read as
 *      0 it wrote 0 back even when armor absorbed the hit entirely, destroying the
 *      stored Hit Protection with no message and no way to get it back.
 *   2. The sheet's _getSubmitData guard covered `character` but not `hireling`,
 *      though actor.js routes BOTH through _prepareCharacterData — and AppV1 sets
 *      submitOnClose, so closing the sheet was enough.
 *
 * Both assert on the SOURCE value (toObject()), never the derived one: reading
 * actor.system.hp.value here would report 0 in both the fixed and broken cases and
 * pass for the wrong reason.
 *
 *   2b-2d. Encumbrance follows the ROLE (2026-08-01, `livesByPlayerRules`): a
 *      loaded MOUNT keeps its HP and its input submits; a role-npc PERSON at
 *      capacity reads 0 with the stored value intact and the submit stripped —
 *      exactly a PC; a full CONTAINER neither reads 0 nor loses HP edits, which
 *      is the assertion that the re-key did not simply widen review #5's bug.
 *      Each leg carries an instance shadow of the getter as its fail-witness,
 *      in both directions, proving BOTH sites read the one getter.
 *
 *   3. The chat Apply-damage button — the one path into
 *      Damage.onClickChatMessageApplyButton, which nothing exercised before it
 *      was converted off the repo's last jQuery call. A card carrying two
 *      `;`-joined token ids in data-targets is clicked and both tokens' actors
 *      must lose HP. The click lands on the ICON inside the anchor, where a real
 *      pointer lands: the handler hangs off the anchor, so this is what keeps
 *      `event.currentTarget` (right) distinct from `event.target` (wrong) — a
 *      conversion that reaches for the wrong one goes red here, not in a user's
 *      game. The shift-click branch (toggle targeting) is not covered: it needs
 *      interactive canvas state and reads the same data-targets string.
 *
 *   3b-3c. The card is pinned to the scene it was ROLLED on, not the one being
 *      looked at. `canvas.scene` is the viewer's, so a party that moved on left
 *      every id missing and the button applying nothing — with no message, since
 *      a miss posts no damage card and no card looks exactly like "armor
 *      absorbed it". 3b views a second scene, forces the log to re-render (the
 *      rebind is where the failure was permanent) and clicks. 3c mixes a live id
 *      with a dead one and asserts the survivor is damaged AND the miss is
 *      reported.
 *
 *   4. Fatigue is never refused (2026-08-05 ruling). A full pack does not stop a
 *      spell being cast, so Fatigue lands and the character goes over capacity;
 *      they clear it by dropping something, which is their choice to make. The
 *      character is built to EXACTLY the limit, never over it, or "used exceeds
 *      max" would already be true before the click. It refused in TWO places —
 *      the button's guard and createOwnedItem's behind it — so this clicks the
 *      real button: removing either guard alone leaves the button refusing while
 *      every unit-level assertion passes. The same section pins the BOUNDARY the
 *      ruling draws, which is the part most likely to erode — an unflagged
 *      create on the same full character must still be refused (overflow is owed
 *      to Fatigue and to what generation grants, not to ordinary acquisition),
 *      and a direct grant of three more items must land whole.
