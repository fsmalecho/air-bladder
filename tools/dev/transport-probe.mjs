/**
 * Transports acceptance probe: prove that transports are EDITABLE documents the
 * shop references (not an inlined price list), that buying one mints a
 * keeper-linked container Actor, and that the worn/mount slot distinction holds.
 *
 *   node tools/dev/transport-probe.mjs    (needs Foundry running, world launched)
 *
 * Steps, driven headless as GM:
 *   1. ONE pack: the shop's "Transports & Containers" table references the
 *      Mounts & Transports ACTOR pack for every row — 17 npc documents in 3
 *      folders (Containers / Mounts / Transports), the worn shapes included —
 *      and the legacy `transports` Item pack is asserted GONE. Capacity/cost
 *      are read off the referenced document.
 *   2. Buy a MOUNT (Mule): a connected NPC is created with the document's
 *      capacity, coins deducted, and the buyer's OWN slot usage is unchanged
 *      -- a mount carries its own pool.
 *   3. Buy a WORN container (Backpack): role container and hp 0/0 cross the till
 *      from its document. 3a: the till's LEGACY Item branch (old worlds'
 *      tables) still INFERS both from a synthesized transport-Item payload.
 *   3b. Buy a VEHICLE (Cart): role transport and hp 0/0 cross the till from the
 *      document -- the review-#5 stat-block guarantee.
 *   4. Edit the Mule ACTOR document's capacity in the pack, buy another, and
 *      assert the new NPC reflects the edit -- the reference guarantee.
 *   5. Buying refuses when the buyer cannot afford it.
 *   6. Everything bought is an npc now, so all of it is directory-visible.
 *   7. Revert the document and delete every actor the probe made.
 * Exits non-zero on any failed assertion or console error.
