/**
 * The `role` re-stamp: a world upgraded from before the field must come out
 * stamped, a world upgraded across the HIRELING-ROLE COLLAPSE must come out
 * converted, and the Warden's later choices must never be re-stamped at all.
 *
 * `role` replaced `forHire` and `inanimate` (docs/npc-roles-plan.md). Then the
 * `hireling` role itself collapsed back into `npc` + `forHire` (2026-08-01,
 * NPC_ROLES). Two layers make old documents read correctly, and this probe
 * covers both:
 *
 *   - **The shim** (NpcData.migrateData) derives a role in memory from the
 *     legacy fields, AND converts a stored "hireling" to npc + forHire, on
 *     every load. Provable without persistence: CONSTRUCT an unsaved document
 *     and read what it derives. The conversion half is load-bearing in a way
 *     the derivation half never was — "hireling" is no longer in the enum, so
 *     without it every stored one fails validation.
 *   - **migrateNpcRoles** persists whatever the shim derived, on every npc-typed
 *     world actor, selecting on NOTHING.
 *
 * The blindness is the interesting part, and this probe is why it is blind.
 * Neither broken state can be seen from a client: `migrateData` rewrites
 * `_source` during construction, and `cleanData` PRUNES unknown keys out of it,
 * so a stored "hireling" and a stored `inanimate` are both invisible. The
 * previous version of this migration selected on `"inanimate" in _source.system`
 * and matched nothing, ever — and the previous version of this probe could not
 * tell, because it read `_source` too and read the same pruned object.
 *
 * So the seeding goes around the data model entirely, through the same socket
 * the database backend uses:
 * `SocketInterface.dispatch("modifyDocument", {action: "update", ...})` plants
 * the value the server will actually store — including a `-=role` deletion, for
 * a document that genuinely predates the field — and `{action: "get"}` reads the
 * RAW server record back. That is the only view of the database a client has,
 * and the only way this migration can be witnessed rather than assumed.
 *
 * This is the class of defect a fresh-world validation cannot see by
 * construction. It needs the real `ready`-hook path, so the probe RELOADS and
 * the migrations run exactly as they do for a user opening their world the
 * morning after an update.
 *
 * Usage: npm run dev:role-migration
