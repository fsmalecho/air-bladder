/**
 * The ORDER a generated loadout arrives in, and where a later item lands.
 *
 * Five bands, top to bottom: weapons, armor, everything else, light sources
 * (each with its fuel directly beneath it), Rations. Written as each item's
 * `sort` by `orderGrantedItems` (module/gear.js) at the four generators, and
 * read back by `_sortItemsForDisplay` — so this asserts the RENDERED ROW ORDER,
 * never the stored array. The rules describe what a player sees.
 *
 * Why these four fixtures and not four random rolls:
 *
 *   - A 2e **Marchguard** grants "Rations, Lantern, Oil Can, Long Sword, Boiled
 *     Leather" — every band, the fuel pairing, and a build order that is very
 *     nearly the reverse of the target. A leg whose input was already in the
 *     right order would prove nothing.
 *   - A Barebones **Oil Collector** grants "Lantern, Oil Can, Sealable Bottle",
 *     and the Barebones kit adds Rations and a Torch, so its light band holds a
 *     paired lamp AND a loose torch.
 *   - A Barebones **Acolyte** grants a "Spellbook" instruction row, the book
 *     band's fixture (2026-08-21): the resolved book — a scroll under GLOG,
 *     same type — must sit after the rolled weapon/armor, before the rest.
 *   - A **hireling** takes a random career, and that is safe to leave random:
 *     all twelve in npc-careers-2e.json begin "Rations, <a light>", so the two
 *     bands this is about are present by construction rather than by luck.
 *   - An **NPC** takes a random Background, and its kit always adds Rations and
 *     a Torch, for the same reason.
 *
 * The band rule is RESTATED here rather than imported from gear.js. It is the
 * thing under test, and a probe that asks the code what the answer should be
 * cannot fail.
 *
 * Two negative controls, both in-page, both against documents this probe made:
 *   - ORDERING: zero every item's sort on the generated Marchguard and
 *     re-render. `_sortItemsForDisplay` falls back to display name, so the list
 *     goes alphabetical — Lantern, Long Sword, Oil Can — and the Oil Can is no
 *     longer under its lamp. Without this leg, "the order is right" could just
 *     be the alphabet agreeing by luck for this loadout.
 *   - APPENDING: replace `CairnItem._preCreateOperation` with a no-op, which is
 *     exactly the pre-fix state, and watch the new item land FIRST. (That also
 *     lifts the one-book wall sharing the method; this leg creates a rope, so
 *     nothing about books is exercised either way.)
 *
 * World state — the reorder setting and every actor created here — is restored
 * from NODE in a finally, never from inside a page that may have died.
 *
 * Usage: npm run dev:grant-order
