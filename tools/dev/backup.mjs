/**
 * Snapshot the two things in this project that git does NOT protect.
 *
 *   node tools/dev/backup.mjs [--label <text>] [--list] [--prune-only]
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-04 a `build:packs` run destroyed roughly five
 * hours of a Warden's compendium work — monster art assigned inside Foundry,
 * plus a description fix. `build` regenerates `packs/` FROM `src/packs/`, so
 * anything edited in the world since the last `extract` is overwritten, and
 * `packs/` is gitignored, LevelDB keeps no history, and Foundry writes no
 * automatic backups. There was nothing to recover from. The guard in
 * tools/packs.mjs now refuses that build; this is the belt to its braces,
 * because a guard only catches the failure it was written for.
 *
 * WHAT IS AT RISK, precisely:
 *
 *   packs/            generated LevelDB. Gitignored BY DESIGN — it is binary,
 *                     unmergeable and rewritten by the act of opening it. But
 *                     "generated" is only true until a Warden edits a compendium
 *                     inside Foundry, and from that moment until someone runs
 *                     `extract`, packs/ holds the ONLY copy of that work.
 *   the world data    actors, scenes, journals, settings. Never in git at all.
 *                     Every probe in tools/dev/ writes to it, and a migration
 *                     phase rewrites documents across the whole world.
 *
 * Snapshots land OUTSIDE the repo (they must survive a clean checkout, and they
 * must never be committable), newest-first by name, pruned to KEEP.

/**
 * Recursive copy that SKIPS what it cannot read instead of aborting.
 *
 * Foundry holds an exclusive handle on each pack's `LOCK` file while the server
 * runs, and `fs.cpSync` on the tree dies with EPIPE on the first one — which
 * would mean backups only work while Foundry is stopped, i.e. exactly when the
 * data is least likely to be at risk and least likely to be remembered. A
 * LevelDB `LOCK` is a zero-byte mutex and carries no data, so skipping it costs
 * nothing; the `.ldb`, `.log`, `MANIFEST` and `CURRENT` files are the content
 * and they copy fine open. A partial snapshot is a floor under the loss, not a
 * transactionally perfect image, and that is the right trade for a safety net.
