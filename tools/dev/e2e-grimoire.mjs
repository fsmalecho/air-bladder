/**
 * The item Grimoire — pages, the one-book wall, travel, and the cast flow
 * (module/grimoire.js + CairnItem, 2026-08-09).
 *
 *   npm run dev:grimoire      (dev world on :30000; needs Alice — npm run dev:players)
 *
 * Two phases, the GM page staying open through Alice's (the dev:grimoire
 * shape the old role-book probe set): the GM owns the fixtures and the
 * enforcement legs, Alice proves a player can cast from her own character.
 *
 * DICE ARE SHADOWED, never trusted: the cast legs pin
 * `CONFIG.Dice.randomUniform` to a planted sequence in-page (restored in
 * finally), so "doubles" and "two dice came up 4-6" are chosen by the leg,
 * not rolled — a doubles assertion on a real 2d6 greens one run in six.
 *
 * Legs:
 *   1. resolveSpellText, as a unit: block selection by power (preamble kept,
 *      absent block = whole text), [sum]/[dice]/[dado] substitution,
 *      arithmetic ([sum*10], the × spelling), and the refusal to touch
 *      non-numeric brackets ([8 HP, 3 STR...]). A resolved value comes back
 *      wrapped in a grimoire-resolved span whose tooltip holds the authored
 *      expression (ruling 2026-08-10) — asserted as the exact shape here,
 *      and on the rendered card in leg 6.
 *   2. Transmute: with a Grimoire carried, a spellbook row offers the control
 *      and the confirm binds it — bound, weightless, grouped after the book's
 *      row with a Page chip, slots freed. A scroll transmutes too, and comes
 *      out a PAGE: scroll off, uses cleared. Before any page exists the book
 *      row has no Cast control; after the first it does.
 *   3. Bound is forever: a direct un-bind write is stripped, a hostile write
 *      (bound off, weightless off) leaves both pinned. A BOOK's identity is
 *      just as permanent — a write clearing `grimoireKey` is stripped while
 *      the rest of that same write lands (review #15).
 *   4. The one-book wall, BOTH layers independently: the drop handler returns
 *      null (affordance), and a bare createEmbeddedDocuments is refused by
 *      _preCreate (enforcement). An npc PILE takes two books happily — the
 *      wall is character-only.
 *   5. Page capacity: at pages == grimoirePages the transmute control is gone
 *      AND the handler refuses (a sheet rendered before the book filled must
 *      not be a way through).
 *   6. The cast, seeded [4,4]: public card carries the localized spell name
 *      and the RESOLVED effect (sum 8 -> "80 damage"), whisper goes to the
 *      caster alone with dice, sum, the 2-Fatigue line, the Add-2-Fatigue
 *      button, the Mishap line and a drawn Mishaps-table row (world-first
 *      resolution against the shipped pack). Both tiles identify themselves
 *      in the flavor line — a lit "GLOG" tag opens it, then "{name}'s Spell"
 *      on the card, and on doubles the whisper's escalates to the mishap
 *      wording (rulings 2026-08-10).
 *   7. The cast, seeded [1,4]: no doubles -> no mishap, and the whisper SAYS
 *      so outright (the no-mishap line, absent on doubles); its flavor stays
 *      the plain spell line; the fatigue line takes its _one form. Block
 *      selection picks the power-2 block. A third cast, seeded [4] on ONE
 *      die, proves the dice line's own _one form ("Rolled 1 magic die,
 *      result is 4") — a lone number must read as a result, never a count.
 *   8. The Fatigue button: clicked at a FULL pack it still lands both
 *      Fatigue items (ignoreCapacity — a cost, never refused); the message
 *      flag spends it, so a second click adds nothing.
 *   9. Dice cap: free slots pin the power select (min(4, free)); at zero
 *      free slots the cast refuses with the no-dice warning.
 *  10. Travel: dropping the book on a pile moves it AND every page; dropping
 *      it back brings the library home; a page dragged alone is refused.
 *  10b. TWO books on one shelf (issue #17, fsmalecho 2026-08-16): each book
 *      keeps its own pages through the move, the one left behind keeps its
 *      library, the receiving book stays inside its page cap, and the pile's
 *      own sheet groups each page under the book it belongs to.
 *  10c. The unkeyed legacy page, both ways round: ambiguous on a two-book
 *      shelf, so it stays; unambiguous when one book remains, so it travels.
 *  10d. A DUPLICATED actor's book (review #15): duplicating an actor copies its
 *      book's key, so moving that copy back makes `_preCreate` re-mint the
 *      arrival — and the pages must be re-stamped from the book that actually
 *      landed, or the pre-existing book claims them all over again.
 *  10e. The same mechanism's other half: a book riding inside an
 *      `Actor.create` PAYLOAD reaches no item-level create seam at all, so it
 *      is keyed on the actor side — and its page stays its own when a second
 *      book joins the shelf, which an unkeyed book could not manage.
 *  10f. The scroll cast, including CANCEL: the dialog's Cancel resolves null
 *      rather than its own action string, posts no card and spends no charge.
 *  11. Alice casts from her own character end-to-end: public card + whisper
 *      addressed to Alice, not the GM.
 *  12. The stamp migration, across a real RELOAD: books written before
 *      `grimoireKey` existed get one; a page on a shelf holding ONE book is
 *      matched to it wherever it sits in the inventory; and on a shelf holding
 *      two, NO page is matched and the shelf is named in the log — nothing in
 *      the data says which book, and the item order is not the creation order
 *      to fall back on (measured here: a page planted first came back between
 *      two planted after it).
 *
 * Everything planted is swept from Node in finally, names and ids printed.

  // Warden opening their world after the update.
  //
  // THE STRIP GOES THROUGH THE RAW SOCKET (review #15), and the reason is the
  // point of the fix it now sits behind: `_preUpdate` strips a write clearing
  // `grimoireKey`, so the document layer can no longer produce this shape at
  // all — which is exactly what a legacy book IS, a record written before the
  // field existed rather than one somebody cleared. The precondition check
  // below caught the change the moment the guard landed; it reported "3 already
  // stamped" and the migration then had nothing to do while every leg after it
  // still passed on keys minted at CREATE. A fixture that quietly stops being
