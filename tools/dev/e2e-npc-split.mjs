/**
 * The NPC / Hireling split (2026-08-20) — e2e.
 *
 *   npm run dev:npc-split      (dev world on :30000, which runs the working tree)
 *
 * `npc` was one role until this change: a person with a Career, a For Hire box
 * and a Day Rate. It is two now — the hireling the party PAYS, and the NPC the
 * party MEETS, who has a Background off the Warden's Guide table and four
 * traits of their own (Quirk, Goal, Virtue, Vice) off that book's NPC tables.
 *
 * The migration half lives in `dev:role-migration`, which plants a genuine
 * pre-split document through the raw socket. This probe is about what the two
 * roles ARE once they exist, and it goes through the real generators rather
 * than seeding documents: the whole risk in a split like this is a call site
 * that still writes the old role or reads the old field, and a seeded actor
 * cannot catch one.
 *
 * An NPC's STATBLOCK is rolled (2026-08-20, the day after the split): 3d6 a
 * piece and 1d6 HP, because a hireling's numbers arrive with its career and an
 * NPC has no career. Section 6 makes five of them — one rolled statblock is
 * indistinguishable from a fixed one — and its control is a planted npc with
 * nothing written, which must still read the schema's 10/10/10 and 6.
 *
 * The trait keys are the interesting part. `virtue` and `vice` exist on BOTH
 * sets and differ by SOURCE TABLE, so an NPC is "Shrewd" off the Warden's Guide
 * list where a character is "Honest" off tables-2e. Same stored key on purpose
 * — which is what makes re-roling an actor lossless, and what the round-trip
 * leg at the end proves.
