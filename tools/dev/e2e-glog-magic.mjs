/**
 * GLOG Magic as an OVERRIDING setting: generation, and the total conversion.
 *
 *   npm run dev:glog-magic     (needs Foundry running, dev world launched)
 *
 * The ruling this gates (2026-08-05): while `enable-glog-magic` is on, only
 * GLOG and custom spells are used — generation's random pool and named grants
 * exclude canon, every granted spell lands as a SPELLSCROLL — and FLIPPING THE
 * SETTING ON CONVERTS THE WORLD, totally: every canon spellbook anywhere
 * becomes a GLOG spellscroll and every canon scroll's text swaps, uses
 * untouched. The invariant afterwards: no canon spell text exists anywhere.
 * Flipping OFF converts nothing back (accepted at ruling time).
 *
 * Legs:
 *   1. GLOG OFF (the regression direction): a "Spellbook (X)" grant is a real
 *      BOOK carrying the canon wording; random books are books; random scrolls
 *      carry canon text. The setting itself is the control for leg 3 — no
 *      source edit flips behaviour, the switch does.
 *   2. The SWEEP, upgrade-style: plant every migration branch in canon state —
 *      a world item, an owned book, an owned SPENT scroll, an UNLINKED-token
 *      carrier (a delta-only book a game.actors walk cannot reach), a book in
 *      a LOCKED world compendium, one no-counterpart custom spell, and a book
 *      under a canon name whose GLOG counterpart is RENAMED (GLOG_NAME_ALIASES)
 *      — flip the setting, poll, and confirm each planted document was REWRITTEN:
 *      books are scrolls with the GLOG wording and `glog: true`, the spent
 *      scroll swapped text but kept `uses.value` 0, the no-counterpart spell
 *      converted in FORM and kept its own words, the pack was re-locked.
 *      (Prototype tokens carry no items — actor coverage IS their coverage,
 *      so there is no separate prototype leg to plant.)
 *      Control: the invariant checker runs BEFORE the flip and must REPORT the
 *      planted canon documents — proving the detector fires on unconverted
 *      state, so the zero-violations assertion afterwards can fail.
 *   3. Generation under GLOG, while the sweep runs: every random draw resolves
 *      inside GLOG ∪ More Spellbooks with ZERO canon-pack reads (getIndex /
 *      getDocument / getDocuments wrapped and counted), every drawn spell is a
 *      scroll, and the named grant comes back as a scroll wearing the GLOG
 *      wording with `glog: true`.
 *   4. Idempotence: a second, direct `runGlogConversion()` changes nothing —
 *      `_stats.modifiedTime` identical across the planted set.
 *   5. The CREATE seam (2026-08-09 ruling: there are no spellbooks in GLOG):
 *      what ARRIVES after the flip converts too — a canon book created on a
 *      character lands as an unspent scroll wearing the GLOG wording; a
 *      GLOG-pack drag (the reported repro: a dropped Haste stayed a book)
 *      lands as an unspent scroll whether the pack stores books or scrolls;
 *      a no-counterpart book converts in FORM and keeps its own words; a
 *      BOUND page arrives a page (the travel bundle), and the sweep-side
 *      immunity is asserted on `glogConversionDiff` as a PURE FUNCTION —
 *      never by running the world sweep against a defeated skip, which would
 *      be a real write. The off direction is leg 2b's plant itself: created
 *      with the setting off, the plants must ARRIVE as books.
 *   6. The invariant, world-wide: no spellbook item anywhere still carries the
 *      canon wording of a spell whose GLOG counterpart differs (the two
 *      byte-identical spells are skipped — for them "canon text" IS the GLOG
 *      text and the claim would be unfalsifiable).
 *
 * World hygiene, because the flip is DESTRUCTIVE and the dev world is shared
 * with a human: every pre-existing spellbook item in the sweep's coverage is
 * snapshotted to NODE before anything runs and restored by targeted diff in a
 * Node-level finally — restore updates OMIT `system.scroll` when it is not
 * changing, because writing `scroll: true` over a scroll re-enters the
 * transition branch of CairnItem._preUpdate and would REFILL a spent scroll.
 * Planted documents are deleted, names and ids printed at plant time.
 *
 * A world that arrives CONVERTED (the setting already ON — the dev world since
 * the user turned GLOG on to play) is handled, not refused: the probe flips
 * OFF for the canon legs (converting nothing back, by ruling), the mid-run
 * flip re-converts, and teardown leaves the setting ON exactly as found —
 * `withSettings`' snapshot sees no diff, so no teardown flip races cleanup.
 * The item restore above still returns every PRE-EXISTING spellbook to its
 * as-found state, unconverted strays included: fixing user content is the
 * sweep's job on a real flip, never a probe's.
