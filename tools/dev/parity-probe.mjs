/**
 * The three parity items ported from the system this descends from:
 *
 *   1. Failed career is EDITABLE — a dice re-roll and a picker on the sheet, not
 *      a value you are stuck with from generation.
 *   2. The failed-career line respects its GM setting live: switching the setting
 *      off hides it on an already-generated character.
 *   3. The Omen field is 2e's alone: absent on a Barebones sheet
 *      unconditionally (the show-omens-barebones lending setting was removed
 *      2026-08-09), present on a 2e sheet — the differential that proves the
 *      hiding is the content source, not a broken field.
 *   4. ...and the Warden's `show-omens` switch (2026-08-17) takes the field off
 *      a 2e sheet too, WITHOUT clearing the stored text. Read-shadowed in-page,
 *      never written to the world.
 *
 * Drives a real Barebones character rather than inspecting config, because every
 * one of these is a context/handler question and reading the setting back proves
 * nothing about whether the sheet honours it.
