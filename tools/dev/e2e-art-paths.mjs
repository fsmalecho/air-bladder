/**
 * The art/ move reaches every kind of document that stores an image path.
 *
 * The four picker galleries moved under `art/` on 2026-08-04. That looks like a
 * folder rename and is not one: an image path is COPIED onto a document when it
 * is created and never re-read from the system, so every world made before the
 * move points at where its art used to be. `migrateArtPaths` in module/cairn.js
 * rewrites them on ready, by PREFIX, so hand-picked art moves too.
 *
 * The failure this exists for is a SURFACE THE MIGRATION FORGOT. A missed
 * collection is invisible in aggregate — the sheets look right, the compendiums
 * look right, and one Warden's own roll table quietly serves broken images
 * forever. So this plants an old path on EVERY surface the migration claims to
 * cover and checks each one independently:
 *
 *   1. a world Item's img
 *   2. an Actor's img
 *   3. that Actor's prototypeToken.texture.src   (a second field on one document)
 *   4. an owned Item on that Actor               (embedded, its own copy)
 *   5. an unlinked Scene token's texture.src     (embedded, holds its own texture)
 *   6. a RollTable result's img                  (a SNAPSHOT, not a live read —
 *      the surface the .png migration never needed and this one does)
 *   7. an img already under art/ in the OLD FORMAT (the re-encode rule, which
 *      the prefix table structurally cannot reach) — ONE PER RE-ENCODED
 *      GALLERY, since they are separate rules and one entry proves only itself
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL, in-page and in both directions. `icons/` deliberately did
 * NOT move, and an external URL must never be touched: both are planted too and
 * must come back BYTE-IDENTICAL. Without them "the migration rewrote everything"
 * is equally satisfied by a migration that rewrites indiscriminately, which
 * would break every class icon in the world it was meant to fix.
 *
 * Preconditions are established here, never inherited — every document is
 * created by this file and deleted in a Node-level finally, so a throw partway
 * through cannot leave `zz-art-path-*` litter behind for the next run to pass on.
 *
 * Usage: npm run dev:art-paths
