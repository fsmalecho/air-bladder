/**
 * Actor-directory presentation:
 *   1. The "Generate PC" button uses the d6 icon.
 *   2. Container/transport actor thumbnails are grayscale; characters are not.
 *
 * This probe used to cover two more things. Both were removed on purpose, and
 * neither should come back:
 *
 * - **Chat/dice re-skinned as the black-and-white sheet.** `f00e72c` deliberately
 *   reverted every NON-SHEET surface to Foundry's own colours and fonts so they
 *   become theme-aware for free. Asserting Alegreya + #f5f5f5 + a black header on
 *   a chat card now asserts a bug. The probe kept failing green-field for weeks
 *   because nothing ran it.
 * - **The "Spellbook — " inventory prefix.** It read the sheet root as
 *   `actor.sheet.element?.[0]`, an ApplicationV1 (jQuery) idiom. On
 *   ApplicationV2 the root is a <form>, and HTMLFormElement is indexed by its
 *   own controls — so that expression quietly returned the first <input>, whose
 *   querySelector matches nothing. The assertion read `null` forever and never
 *   errored. The prefix is covered properly by `npm run dev:i18n-render`, which
 *   drives it in both language directions.
