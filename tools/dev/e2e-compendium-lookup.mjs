/**
 * `module/compendium.js` — the shared name→document lookup that the marketplace,
 * generation, damage and the Kettlewright importer all sit on.
 *
 *   npm run dev:compendium     (needs Foundry running with a world launched)
 *
 * Two things it gates, neither of which any other probe can see:
 *
 * 1. **How the lookup finds a document.** `findCompendiumItem` used to call
 *    `pack.getDocuments()` — which ALWAYS round-trips the database and constructs
 *    every document in the pack (`compendium-collection.mjs:411`, no cache) — and
 *    then read one name off each. It runs once per lookup, so opening the shop,
 *    which resolves ~77 compendium results, loaded whole packs ~77 times. The fix
 *    matches in the pack INDEX and materializes one document.
 *
 *    Counting is the only honest way to assert this. The catalog was CORRECT
 *    before the fix and is correct after; the entire difference is how much work
 *    happened, so a functional assertion cannot fail either way. The counter
 *    discriminates on the query: `getDocuments()` with no query is a full pack
 *    load, while `getDocuments({_id})` is what `getDocument` issues for a single
 *    document — the cheap call, and the one we WANT to see.
 *
 * 2. **A missing table or item degrades instead of throwing.** `drawTable`
 *    dereferenced a lookup its own JSDoc documents as resolving to `undefined`,
 *    so a renamed or deleted table threw from wherever the draw was requested —
 *    mid-generation, with nothing naming the table. `damage.js` guards the
 *    identical call and says why; this covers the rest.
 *
 * Exits non-zero on any failed assertion or console error.
