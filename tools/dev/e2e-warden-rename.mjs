/**
 * The "Warden" GM-account rename: reversible, scoped, and collision-safe.
 *
 * The account NAME is world data but the label is localized per CLIENT, so
 * whichever GM logs in first decides what every player sees. The original code
 * matched only the two default names ("Gamemaster" / "Game Master"), so the
 * instant it wrote, nothing matched again — a GM who switched language, or turned
 * the setting off, was stuck with no way back short of editing the user by hand.
 * It now records the replaced name in a `renamedFrom` flag.
 *
 * Everything here runs across real page RELOADS, because the rename runs once, on
 * `ready`. Three parts:
 *
 *   A. the cycle, on the account that was actually renamed: turning the setting
 *      off hands the old name back and clears the flag; turning it on re-applies.
 *   B. a deliberately-named GM is never touched, in either state.
 *   C. Foundry enforces UNIQUE user names. A second GM that cannot take the name
 *      must be skipped quietly — the first version of this threw out of the ready
 *      hook, aborting the loop mid-way. Found by this probe, not by review.
 *
 * Usage: npm run dev:warden-rename

 * Reload, and do not return until the rename hook has actually had its chance.
 *
 * `cairn.js:190` bails out when another GM is the active one -- deliberately, so a
 * two-GM world cannot half-apply a rename. Right after a reload the PREVIOUS session
 * is often still registered active, so the hook runs, sees a stranger, and silently
 * does nothing. Waiting on `game.ready` cannot help: ready fires AFTER the hook, so
 * by the time it is true the decision has already been made and lost.
 *
 * So read `activeGM` with no wait at all -- that is what the hook itself saw -- and
 * if it saw a stranger, let the stale session drop and reload AGAIN. The hook is
 * registered with `Hooks.once`, so a fresh page is the only way to give it another go.
 *
 * Found 2026-07-30: the off-direction won this race and the on-direction lost it, so
 * the probe reported "expected Warden, got Gamemaster" -- indistinguishable, from the
 * outside, from the feature being broken.
