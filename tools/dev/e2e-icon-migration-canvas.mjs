/**
 * What the canvas actually shows on the first boot after an icon migration.
 *
 * The ordering is not a race, it is guaranteed: Game#setupGame starts the canvas
 * (game.mjs:763), AWAITS it (:776), and only then fires `ready` (:779) — which is
 * where module/cairn.js runs migrateIconsToSvg(). So on the first boot after an
 * upgrade the canvas always draws scene tokens from paths the update deleted.
 *
 * Foundry is expected to absorb that: loadTexture falls back to mystery-man on a
 * 404 (loader.mjs:775-778), PlaceablesLayer._draw uses Promise.allSettled, and
 * Token#_onAnimationUpdate sets `redraw` on any texture.src change
 * (token.mjs:2420-2421) — which applyRenderFlags honours BEFORE its !drawn guard
 * (placeable-object.mjs:430-436), so even a placeable whose first draw failed
 * recovers. This probe is what turns that reading into evidence.
 *
 * Method: plant two tokens on a scene and make it ACTIVE — Game#initializeCanvas
 * reads game.scenes.current while canvas.ready is false, which resolves to the
 * ACTIVE scene, so a merely-viewed scene would not survive the reload.
 *
 *   subject — texture.src on a deleted .png, i.e. the pre-migration state
 *   control — texture.src on a shipped .svg
 *
 * The control is the reference. Software WebGL here runs at ~3-4 FPS, and without
 * a known-good token on the same scene a GPU hiccup is indistinguishable from the
 * defect. If the control fails to draw, the verdict is INCONCLUSIVE, not FAIL.
 *
 * Usage: npm run dev:icon-canvas
