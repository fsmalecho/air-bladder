/**
 * i18n SOURCE gate — compares the code to lang/es.json.
 *
 * The system now ships one language file, so nothing compares files to each
 * other any more. What still needs catching is the one thing no language file
 * can fix: a string that was never routed through `game.i18n` at all — it is
 * absent from es.json because it is nowhere. That blindness is how
 * `title="Double click to change limit"` shipped, the only hint the
 * double-click-to-set-equipment-limit feature exists.
 *
 * Four classes, all checkable offline:
 *
 *   missing    a key referenced by module/, templates/ or the macros pack's
 *              command JS that es.json lacks. Foundry renders the raw key, so
 *              the user sees "CAIRN.Whatever".
 *   unused     a key in es.json that nothing references. Dead weight a
 *              translator is nonetheless asked to translate.
 *   hardcoded  user-visible English in module/ or templates/ that never passes
 *              through game.i18n. Untranslatable by construction.
 *   unlabelled a gallery category in a MANIFEST with no label key — the one the
 *              first two are structurally blind to. See CATEGORY_LABELS below.
 *   rawattr    a `{{{ }}}` inside an HTML attribute, where not escaping means a
 *              quotation mark in the value ends the attribute. Added 2026-08-07.
 *   duplicate  the same key declared twice in one object of a lang file.
 *              JSON.parse keeps the LAST and says nothing, so the file still
 *              loads, still flattens to the same key set, and the earlier
 *              string simply stops being used. Added 2026-08-20, after a new
 *              die on the NPC sheet was given `CAIRN.RollBackground` — a key
 *              the character sheet's background die already had — and silently
 *              re-worded that one's tooltip. This is the only class here that
 *              reads the lang files as TEXT, because it is invisible to
 *              anything that parses them first.
 *
 * All six are errors. A warning that is permanently non-zero is a gate nobody
 * reads, which is the failure mode this file exists to correct.
